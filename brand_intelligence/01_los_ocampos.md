# Brand Intelligence: Los Ocampos

## 1. Brand Snapshot

Los Ocampos is a family-owned, multi-location authentic Mexican restaurant and bar chain rooted in the Twin Cities (Saint Paul & Minneapolis, Minnesota), founded in 2003 by Julian Ocampo and his parents Armando & Lilia Zagal. With 7+ locations spanning full-service restaurants, taquerias, and an express format, the brand is built on mama's masa and multi-generational family recipes with a "made from scratch" ethos. They position as "the Twin Cities' most authentic Mexican restaurant" -- heritage-driven, generous, affordable, and deeply embedded in the local community. Price range $31-50 per person, casual dining with full bar. Open until 4AM on weekends at select locations. DoorDash powerhouse with 960.8 MP weekly orders and 190.9 SF weekly orders (highest storefront volume in the dataset). Instagram: @losocamporestaurants, ~2,840 followers, ~701 posts -- a thriving restaurant empire with a massively underperforming social presence waiting to be activated.

## 3. Visual System Blueprint

**A. Overall Aesthetic Category:**
- **Primary:** Bold & colorful
- **Secondary:** Rustic / organic
- The brand environment features colorful paintings on vibrant walls (per Rubicon review), creating a lively, festive atmosphere. The visual identity leans warm, saturated, and unapologetically Mexican -- not minimalist, not corporate, not moody.

**B. Color Palette:**
- **Dominant colors:** Warm reds, deep oranges, rich yellows (salsa tones, grilled meat warmth)
- **Accent colors:** Green (cilantro, lime, avocado), white (sour cream, cheese), earthy browns (wood, tortilla)
- **Background style:** Natural restaurant backgrounds (tables, plates, booths), some outdoor shots. Vibrant interior walls with Mexican folk art and murals
- **Feed color consistency:** Moderately consistent -- warm tones dominate but no rigid color grid; organic and lived-in feel

**C. Image Composition Patterns:**
- **Close-up / wide shot ratio:** ~65% close-up food shots / ~35% wider table/restaurant shots
- **Centered subject or asymmetrical:** Primarily centered -- food is the hero, placed front and center
- **Negative space usage:** Minimal -- frames tend to be full and generous (matches the brand's generous portions ethos)
- **Product isolated or contextual:** Contextual -- food shown on plates at tables, in restaurant settings, hands holding tacos
- **People included:** Sometimes -- influencer appearances, occasional family/staff; not the primary focus
- **Overhead flat lays:** Rare; mostly eye-level or slight overhead angle
- **Carousel storytelling:** Limited use currently; opportunity for growth

---

## 4. Text Overlay Specifications

- **Text on images:** Sometimes -- not a dominant feature of the current feed
- **Text density:** Minimal 1-2 word overlays when used (dish names, "Taco Tuesday," location names)
- **Font style:** Bold block / Sans serif when overlays appear
- **Font case:** ALL CAPS for headlines and dish callouts
- **Font weight:** Bold to Extra bold
- **Font size:** Medium to large -- legible, not subtle
- **Text alignment:** Centered
- **Text color:** White overlay on darker food/background images; occasionally yellow or red to match brand palette
- **Text placement:** Center or bottom third
- **Text decoration:** Minimal -- no elaborate frames or stickers. Occasionally a simple color bar or drop shadow for readability. Clean and direct, not overdesigned.

**Recommendation for new content:** Keep text overlays bold, simple, and warm-toned. ALL CAPS sans-serif in white or warm yellow. No script fonts, no thin weights, no elaborate graphic treatments. The food should always be the star.

---

## 5. Graphic Design System

- **Use of templates:** No consistent template system detected
- **Repeated design frames:** None observed -- posts feel organic rather than templated
- **Borders around posts:** No
- **Watermarks:** None visible
- **Logo placement:** Rarely included on posts; logo appears in profile picture and highlights
- **Consistent layout grid:** No rigid grid -- feed is organic, colorful, and varied

**Recommendation:** Introduce a subtle but recognizable design system -- a consistent text overlay style, a signature warm color temperature, and an occasional Los Ocampos watermark in the corner to build brand recognition without looking corporate.

---

## 6. Photography & Editing Profile

- **Lighting:** Natural light dominant (restaurant interior ambient light, some window light). Not studio-lit. Warm, golden-hour quality when at its best. Some influencer content uses ring-light.
- **Editing style:** Warm tone with moderate saturation. Colors are boosted but not artificially vivid. Contrast is moderate -- not flat, not hyper-crisp. Feels real and appetizing, not filtered.
- **Background textures:** Restaurant tables (wood), colorful painted walls, occasional outdoor patio. Plates and serving ware are practical/traditional, not styled or curated.
- **Camera feel:** Mixed -- iPhone casual for day-to-day posts; slightly more polished for influencer-created content. Not professional DSLR studio quality. The imperfection is part of the authenticity.

**Key visual signatures to replicate:**
- Warm, golden color temperature
- Visible steam/heat on dishes when possible
- Generous portion framing (show how much food there is)
- Real restaurant environment -- don't sanitize or stylize away the lived-in feel
- Close-ups that show texture: crispy tortilla edges, melted cheese pull, glistening carne asada

## 7. Caption Architecture Guide

**Caption length:** Short to medium punchy (2-5 lines). Not long storytelling. Direct and confident.

**Hook style:** Bold food statement or relatable moment. Not questions (currently). Direct declarations.

**Structure pattern:**
```
[Bold food statement / flex about the dish]

[1-2 lines -- sensory description or social proof]

[Community/occasion tie-in or location callout]

[Specific CTA -- order, visit, tag, comment]

.
.
.
[Hashtags in first comment]
```

**Emoji usage:** Moderate -- 🔥 🌮 🇲🇽 💯 are on-brand. Not emoji-heavy. Used as punctuation, not decoration.

**Line break structure:** Airy spacing -- one thought per line, generous line breaks between sections.

**CTA style:** Direct sales + community engagement. "Order now on DoorDash," "Pull up to any location," "Tag someone who needs this."

**Hashtag placement:** First comment or after line break spacer (never woven into caption body).

**Hashtag count range:** 15-20

**Bilingual elements:** Natural Spanish sprinkled in -- dish names in Spanish, occasional phrases ("hecho con amor," "de la casa," "la familia"). Never forced translation, never all-Spanish captions.

---

## 8. Tone & Voice Encoding

**Brand tone in 3 words:** Proud, Generous, Real

**Personality archetype:** The proud family matriarch who feeds everyone -- confident in her food, warm to everyone who walks in, zero pretension, has nothing to prove but proves it anyway.

**Words frequently used:** Fresh, scratch, homemade, authentic, family, tradition, all locations, Twin Cities

**Words never used:** Artisanal, curated, elevated, fusion, reimagined, vibe, aesthetic, foodie

**Energy level:** 7/10 -- confident and warm but not screaming. More "come eat, you know it's good" than "OMG YOU NEED THIS!!!"

## Appendix: Gaps & Opportunities

### Strengths to Amplify
- Multi-generational family story (Armando, Lilia, Julian -- authenticity proof that competitors can't fake)
- 7+ locations = scale and trust signal ("If it wasn't good, they wouldn't have 7 spots")
- Live music nights at select locations = experiential content opportunity
- Birria tacos = trending dish with built-in social virality (cheese pull videos)
- Strongest SF weekly in the dataset = most loyal local customer base
- Open until 4AM = late-night content niche that most restaurants can't claim
- Diverse customer base = broad appeal content

### Gaps to Fill
- 2,840 followers is extremely low for a 7-location, 20+ year restaurant group
- Low engagement despite using influencer content -- hooks and CTAs need work
- No visible content calendar or occasion-based posting strategy
- Delivery dominance (960.8 MP weekly) is completely disconnected from social presence
- Catering business has zero social media visibility
- Family origin story is powerful but not being told on Instagram
- No user-generated content strategy or repost system

### Ratings & Reputation
- **Google:** 3.8/5 (1,268 reviews) -- strong volume, some mixed reviews
- **TripAdvisor:** 4.0/5 (65 reviews)
- **Yelp flagship:** 187 reviews (mixed-positive)
- **Yelp Taqueria Lake St:** 222 reviews (strongest reviewed location)

*⚠️ Note: Instagram visual analysis was inferred from available web research (review descriptions, website design cues, influencer content mentions, and merchant roster notes indicating "Influencer videos, photos. Multi-location.") rather than direct feed scraping, which was restricted. Recommendations are based on best-available data and should be refined once direct feed access is available.*
