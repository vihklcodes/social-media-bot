## POST 1: Fat Tuesday + Taco Tuesday (Tuesday, February 17)

### Nano Banana Pro Image Prompt
1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation. Overhead flat-lay food photography shot on a bright yellow wood table surface. A generous spread of indulgent Mexican food: 4 quesabirria tacos with crispy golden tortillas and melted cheese spilling out, a stone molcajete bowl filled with sizzling meats and vegetables with visible steam, a small bowl of rich red consomé for dipping, and a frosty margarita glass with a salted rim -- all arranged in a casual, abundant layout on the bright yellow wood. The dishes should be on practical white ceramic plates and in a traditional stone mortar (molcajete). Warm golden lighting from above, moderate saturation, iPhone-casual photography feel. The frame should be full and generous -- no negative space, portions look abundant.

Behind every great Mexican restaurant is an even greater woman 💛🙏 Today we celebrate International Women's Day by honoring the woman who started it all -- our mother Lilia Zagal. She left her home in Tejalpa, Mexico, came to Minnesota, and noticed something was missing: real, authentic Mexican food made the way she made it at home. So she fixed that.

Every handmade masa cake, every sope, every huarache at Los Ocampo starts with her recipe. The same recipe she's been perfecting her entire life. Today we also celebrate Emma Ocampo, who has modernized our operations and helped grow Los Ocampo to 8+ locations across the Twin Cities.

The women of this family built something beautiful. And every time you take a bite, you're tasting their legacy. Gather your familia and join us today at any location -- or order on DoorDash 🌮✨

### Caption Version B
International Women's Day 💛✨ Los Ocampo wouldn't exist without the women who built it. Our mother Lilia Zagal brought her recipes from Tejalpa, Mexico to Minnesota and turned a dream into 8+ restaurants. Her handmade masa -- sopes, huaraches, gorditas -- is the heart of everything on our menu. Every single one pressed by hand with recipes passed down through generations.

And Emma Ocampo, who took our family business and gave it the structure and vision to grow into what it is today. These women didn't just cook food. They built a legacy.

Happy International Women's Day from the Ocampo familia to yours 🙏🌮
