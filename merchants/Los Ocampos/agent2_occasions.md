# Occasion Strategy: Los Ocampos
## Feb 17 - Mar 8, 2026 (3 weeks, 9 occasions)

---

## WEEK 1: Feb 17-22

### 1. Fat Tuesday + Taco Tuesday (Tuesday, February 17)
**Why it fits:** Double hook -- last day of indulgence before Lent AND the most recognizable weekly food day. Los Ocampos' loaded plates (molcajete, quesabirria, machete quesadilla) are built for indulgence. The universe aligned Mardi Gras on a Taco Tuesday.
**Campaign angle:** "Fat Tuesday IS Taco Tuesday. The universe has spoken." Go big -- feature the most over-the-top, indulgent items on the menu. Molcajete Mar y Tierra, loaded quesabirria, margaritas. Position as the last feast before Lent.

### 2. First Lenten Friday (Friday, February 20)
**Why it fits:** Many of Los Ocampos' Latino and Catholic customers observe Lenten Friday meat abstinence. This is the kickoff of a recurring 6-week content series. Los Ocampos has shrimp tacos, fish tacos, cheese enchiladas, veggie burritos, and bean-based dishes that serve this audience directly.
**Campaign angle:** "First Friday of Lent. No meat? No problem." Launch the Lenten Friday series -- highlight seafood and meatless options every Friday through April. Position DoorDash delivery as the easy Lent-compliant dinner solution.

### 3. National Margarita Day (Sunday, February 22)
**Why it fits:** This is THE #1 occasion on the calendar for a Mexican restaurant with a full bar. Margaritas are a core offering. Every Mexican restaurant in America will post -- Los Ocampos needs to own this in the Twin Cities. Falls on a Sunday = family gathering/brunch/dinner occasion.
**Campaign angle:** "Our house margarita has been perfected since 2003. 20+ years of margarita expertise." Highlight the bar program, happy hour pricing, and invite families to celebrate at any of 8+ locations. Pair with DoorDash food ordering for at-home marg parties.

## WEEK 2: Feb 24-Mar 1

### 4. National Tortilla Chip Day + Taco Tuesday (Tuesday, February 24)
**Why it fits:** Tortilla chips and salsa are listed in Los Ocampos' cuisine tags and are the gateway to every meal. This lands on a Taco Tuesday for another double hook. Chips, guac, and salsa are DoorDash-friendly add-ons that increase order size.
**Campaign angle:** "Happy National Tortilla Chip Day. But let's be real -- chips are just the vehicle for our fresh guac and salsa." Feature the from-scratch guacamole and salsa trio. Push DoorDash add-ons. Combine with Taco Tuesday tacos.

### 5. National Chili Day (Thursday, February 26)
**Why it fits:** Chili peppers are the soul of Mexican cuisine. Los Ocampos uses chiles in salsas, birria broth, enchilada sauce, molcajete salsa borracha, and more. Even though "chili" typically means American stew, the chile connection is authentic and on-brand.
**Campaign angle:** "You said chili, we said chile. We've been celebrating chiles every day since 2003." Showcase the different chiles and salsas behind their dishes -- salsa roja, salsa borracha, birria consomé. Educational/cultural content that differentiates from competitors.

### 6. Second Lenten Friday + Game Day (Friday, February 27)
**Why it fits:** Continuing the Lenten Friday series (builds habit and expectation). Position as the go-to Lenten dinner solution on DoorDash.
**Campaign angle:** "Lent Friday, week 2. Have you tried our cheese enchiladas yet? No meat needed when the flavor is this good." Feature a different meatless item each week to keep the series fresh.

## WEEK 3: Mar 3-8

### 7. Taco Tuesday + Double Game Night (Tuesday, March 3)
**Why it fits:** Taco Tuesday PLUS Minnesota Wild (vs. Tampa Bay, 8:30pm) AND Timberwolves (vs. Memphis, 7pm) both at home. Two major pro sports games on the same Taco Tuesday = massive DoorDash ordering opportunity. Twin Cities sports fans need game-day food.
**Campaign angle:** "Taco Tuesday + Wild game + Wolves game. The ultimate excuse to order in." Push DoorDash delivery for game-watching. Feature shareable items: nachos, quesabirria, chips & guac, and margarita pitcher content.

### 8. Third Lenten Friday (Friday, March 6)
**Why it fits:** Week 3 of the Lenten series -- by now the audience expects the pattern. Lean into a specific meatless menu item spotlight.
**Campaign angle:** "Lent Friday, week 3. Our veggie burrito is sneaky good." Feature a single hero meatless item with visceral food description. Drive DoorDash orders with the Lenten hook.

### 9. International Women's Day (Sunday, March 8)
**Why it fits:** The Los Ocampos brand was literally built by a woman -- Lilia Zagal's masa recipes are the foundation of the entire restaurant empire. Emma Ocampo (Julian's wife) modernized the brand operations. This is an authentic, powerful storytelling moment that no competitor can replicate.
**Campaign angle:** "Behind every great Mexican restaurant is an even greater woman." Feature the women of the Ocampo family -- Lilia Zagal (the matriarch whose recipes started it all), Emma Ocampo (the controller modernizing the business). Tell the origin story: a woman from Tejalpa, Mexico noticed Minnesota was missing real Mexican food and decided to fix that. This is family legacy content at its best.
