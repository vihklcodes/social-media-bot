# Brand Intelligence: Los Ocampos

## 1. Brand Snapshot

Los Ocampos is a family-owned, multi-location authentic Mexican restaurant chain rooted in the Twin Cities (Saint Paul & Minneapolis, Minnesota). Founded in 2003 by Armando Ocampo and Lilia Zagal -- immigrants from Tejalpa, a small village in Morelos, Mexico -- the brand is now co-run by their son Julian Ocampo (University of St. Thomas 2018 graduate) and his wife Emma Ocampo (company controller). With 8+ locations spanning full-service restaurants & bars, taquerias, an express/skyway format, and the Machete Cocina Mexicana concept in Woodbury, the brand is built on Lilia's masa recipes and multi-generational family tradition. They position as "the Twin Cities' most authentic Mexican restaurant" -- heritage-driven, generous, affordable, and deeply embedded in the local community. Price range $31-50 per person, casual dining with full bar. Happy hour 3-6pm. Open late at select locations. DoorDash powerhouse with 960.8 MP weekly orders and 190.9 SF weekly orders. Instagram: @losocamporestaurants, ~2,856 followers, 701 posts. TikTok: @losocamporestaurants (same handle, same voice).

**Critical context:** In January 2025, all locations temporarily closed "due to ongoing federal activity" to protect employee and staff safety. A GoFundMe staff relief fund was created. Machete reopened for to-go orders January 20, 2025. The brand has since reopened. This closure is part of the brand's story and reinforces their deep community ties.

## 2. Visual System Blueprint

**A. Overall Aesthetic Category:**
- **Primary:** Bold & colorful
- **Secondary:** Rustic / organic

**B. Color Palette:**
- **Dominant colors:** Warm reds, deep oranges, rich yellows (salsa tones, grilled meat warmth)
- **Accent colors:** Green (cilantro, lime, avocado), white (sour cream, cheese, cotija), earthy browns (masa, tortilla)
- **Background style:** Natural restaurant backgrounds (tables, plates, booths), colorful painted interior walls with Mexican folk art and murals
- **Feed color consistency:** Warm tones dominate -- organic and lived-in feel

**C. Image Composition Patterns (STATIC PHOTO posts):**

> **IMPORTANT: Instagram feed was not directly accessible for scraping (JS rendering). The following observations are from user feedback and web research. Items marked [USER-OBSERVED] come from the merchant manager's direct observation of the feed. Items marked [INFERRED] are based on review photos, press coverage, and web descriptions. These should be refined when direct feed access is available.**

- **Recency priority:** Analysis based on user's observation of recent static photo posts.
- **Camera angle breakdown:** [USER-OBSERVED] Predominantly **overhead/flat-lay** shots for static food photos. This is the dominant camera angle for their food content.
- **Close-up / wide shot ratio:** Majority close-up food shots focused on the dish
- **Centered subject:** Food is centered, hero of the frame
- **Negative space usage:** Minimal -- frames tend to be full and generous (matches generous portions ethos)
- **Product isolated or contextual:** Contextual -- food shown on plates at tables, in restaurant settings
- **People included:** Sometimes -- influencer appearances, occasional family/staff; not the primary focus in static photos
- **Surface/table details:** [USER-OBSERVED] **Bright yellow wood table/surface** is the dominant surface in static food photos. This is a critical detail for Nano Banana Pro replication.
- **Plate/serving ware style:** [INFERRED] Practical restaurant plates and baskets. Quesadillota comes in branded cardboard sleeve. Molcajete served in traditional stone mortar. Standard Mexican restaurant serving ware -- not curated or styled.
- **Carousel storytelling style:** Limited use currently

**D. Interior/Environment (from verified press and reviews):**
- Bright white walls warmed by hanging string lights (Marshall Ave location)
- Mexican cultural art on walls, including historically-themed murals depicting Twin Cities landmarks and traditions
- Colorful sombreros accenting the interior design
- Colorful painted walls with Mexican folk art (Suburban Ave flagship per Rubicon review)
- Outdoor patio at select locations

---

## 3. Text Overlay Specifications (Flyer / Promotional Style)

> **Direction: All posts should function as promotional flyers with text overlays that communicate the occasion and key message at a glance. The food is still the hero, but the text advertises what the post is about.**

- **Text on every image:** Yes -- every post is a flyer-style promotional image
- **Text density:** Headline (2-4 words) + optional sub-headline (1 short line). NOT walls of text.
- **Font style:** Bold sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat Bold, Oswald, or similar clean block typeface)
- **Font case:** ALL CAPS for headline text. Sentence case for sub-headline.
- **Font weight:** Bold to Extra Bold for headlines. Regular to Medium for sub-headlines.
- **Font size relative to image (1030 x 1350 canvas):**
  - Headline: ~30-40% of image width (~310-410px wide). Large enough to read at thumbnail size but not overwhelming.
  - Sub-headline: ~50-60% of image width, but thinner/lighter weight so it doesn't compete with headline.
- **Text alignment:** Centered horizontally
- **Text color:** White (primary). Subtle drop shadow (2px offset, 50% opacity black) for readability over food photos.
- **Brand accent color:** Dark green (#004612) -- can be used for small accent elements (a thin line, a small logo badge, or sub-headline color on lighter backgrounds)
- **Text placement:** Centered in the **bottom 12-18%** of the image. Sits above the food but doesn't overwhelm it. A subtle semi-transparent dark gradient (from transparent at top to ~30% black at bottom) behind the text area ensures readability.
- **Text decoration:** Minimal. No boxes, no frames, no stickers. Just clean text with drop shadow on a subtle gradient. Occasional thin horizontal line between headline and sub-headline.

**Text Content Guidelines:**
- Headline should name the occasion or key hook (e.g., "TACO TUESDAY," "NATIONAL MARGARITA DAY," "LENTEN FRIDAY")
- Sub-headline adds context or CTA (e.g., "The last feast before Lent," "Perfected since 2003," "Order on DoorDash")
- A viewer scrolling should understand what this flyer is advertising WITHOUT reading the caption

## 4. Photography & Editing Profile

> **[Partially INFERRED. Camera angle is USER-OBSERVED. Surface color is USER-OBSERVED. Other details are inferred from review descriptions and web research. Should be refined with direct feed access.]**

- **Lighting:** [INFERRED] Natural light dominant (restaurant interior ambient light, warm golden quality). Not studio-lit. Some influencer content uses ring-light.
- **Editing style:** [INFERRED] Warm tone with moderate saturation. Colors are boosted but not artificially vivid. Moderate contrast -- feels real and appetizing, not over-filtered.
- **Background/surface specifics:** [USER-OBSERVED] **Bright yellow wood table** is the primary surface for static food photos. Restaurant interior visible in background -- colorful painted walls, string lights, Mexican folk art. Plates/baskets on the yellow wood surface.
- **Camera feel:** Mixed -- iPhone casual for day-to-day posts; slightly more polished for influencer-created content
- **Dominant camera angle for static photos:** [USER-OBSERVED] **Overhead flat-lay** is the dominant angle

**Key visual signatures to replicate:**
- **Overhead flat-lay on bright yellow wood** -- this is the #1 visual signature
- Warm, golden color temperature
- Generous portion framing (show abundance)
- Real restaurant environment -- don't sanitize or stylize away the lived-in feel
- Close-ups that show texture: crispy tortilla edges, melted cheese pull, glistening carne asada

---

## 5. Graphic Design System

> **[INFERRED from available data. Should be refined with direct feed access.]**

- **Use of templates:** No consistent template system detected
- **Repeated design frames:** None observed -- posts feel organic rather than templated
- **Borders around posts:** No
- **Watermarks:** None visible
- **Logo placement:** Rarely included on posts; logo appears in profile picture
- **Consistent layout grid:** No rigid grid -- feed is organic, colorful, and varied

---

## 6. Caption Architecture Guide

**Based on 6 REAL verbatim captions from TikTok (@losocamporestaurants -- same account, same voice as Instagram). These are the closest verified proxy since Instagram captions could not be scraped directly.**

### Caption Patterns (from REAL posts):

- **Caption length:** Mix of **long-form storytelling (5-8 sentences, full paragraphs)** and occasional short promotional (1-2 sentences). The brand's default voice is LONG -- they tell stories, describe food in detail, share family legacy. This is NOT a "short punchy" brand.
- **Hook style (verbatim examples):**
  - Question: "Craving some delicious, authentic Mexican food?"
  - Imperative/emotional: "Show her you love her - take her out for tacos and margs at Los Ocampo!"
  - Exclamation: "Hot and ready for you!"
  - Save prompt: "Save this post for your new favorite Taco Tuesday spot in St. Paul"
  - Welcome: "Welcome to Los Ocampo!"
- **Body structure:** Tell origin stories, describe food with sensory detail (lists every ingredient), share the family legacy narrative, call out multiple locations. Typical flow: Hook → food description with specific ingredients → family/legacy tie-in → CTA
- **Emoji usage:** Food emojis (🌮🥑), celebration emojis (🎉✨), drink emojis (🍹🍻). Placed at sentence openings AND endings. Moderate usage -- 4-8 per post. Used as punctuation, not decoration.
- **Line break structure:** Dense paragraphs -- NOT one-line-per-thought. Flowing storytelling with sentences running together.
- **CTA style (verbatim examples):**
  - "Gather your familia and join us for a feast at Los Ocampo today!"
  - "Tag your date and treat her to the best tacos in town!"
  - "Save this post for your new favorite Taco Tuesday spot"
  - "Gather your amigos and familia this weekend, and we'll see you soon!"
  - "Bring your friends, grab a margarita (or 3), and let's taco 'bout a good time!"
- **Hashtag placement:** End of caption, after the CTA
- **Hashtag count range:** 6-7 (compact set, not 20+)
- **Core hashtag set:** #losocampo #mexicanfood #stpaulfoodie #twincitiesfoodie #eatertwincities #mneats (occasionally swaps #mneats for specific tags like #tacos #tacotuesdays)
- **Bilingual elements:** Natural Spanish woven in: "familia," "amigos," dish names (Molcajete Mar y Tierra, salsa borracha, arrachera, Molcajete de Carnes, Molcajete de Mariscos). Never forced, never full-Spanish captions.
- **Voice/personality:** Proud family storyteller. Warm, enthusiastic, community-oriented. Writes like someone who genuinely loves their food and family legacy. Uses food puns occasionally ("let's taco 'bout a good time!").
- **Recurring phrases:** "recipes passed down through generations," "since 2003," "authentic Mexican," "gather your familia," "the Twin Cities," "Los Ocampo near you"
- **Food descriptions:** Extremely specific and visceral -- lists every ingredient with sensory adjectives: "juicy arrachera steak, savory al pastor, tender chicken, flavorful chorizo, and mixed seafood, all simmering in our salsa borracha"

## Appendix: Gaps & Opportunities

### Strengths to Amplify
- Multi-generational family story (Armando & Lilia from Tejalpa → Julian & Emma modernizing -- authenticity proof that competitors can't fake)
- 8+ locations = scale and trust signal
- Machete quesadilla (23-inch, visual spectacle, sharable, social-media-ready)
- Quesabirria tacos = trending dish with built-in social virality (cheese pull videos)
- Strongest SF weekly in the dataset = most loyal local customer base
- January 2025 closure + community resilience = powerful brand story about values
- Diverse customer base = broad appeal content

### Gaps to Fill
- 2,856 followers is extremely low for an 8+ location, 20+ year restaurant group
- Long-form caption style on TikTok is strong but needs consistent posting cadence
- Delivery dominance (960.8 MP weekly) is completely disconnected from social presence
- Catering business has zero social media visibility
- Family origin story is powerful but not being told consistently on Instagram
- No user-generated content strategy or repost system
