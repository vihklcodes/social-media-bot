## 1. Brand Snapshot

Falafel Corner is a 19+ location fast-casual Mediterranean grill franchise centered in the Sacramento, CA metro area (with locations in Roseville, Folsom, Granite Bay, Citrus Heights, Antelope, Stockton, Lodi, Brentwood, Davis, Yuba City, Oakland, Fairfield, and Woodland). Despite having the HIGHEST marketplace weekly average (1,806 orders) in the entire merchant dataset, their Instagram presence is underdeveloped -- 133 followers across 223 posts, with near-zero engagement (0-5 likes per post, zero comments). Their feed is dominated by AI-generated/designed promotional flyers featuring warm amber/orange gradient backgrounds, centered food heroes, and consistent "ORDER NOW" CTAs. Captions follow a rigid formula: emoji pair + one-sentence product description + 3 hashtags + emoji pair. The brand positions itself as affordable, halal, fresh, and generous-portioned Mediterranean food ("not here to reinvent Mediterranean -- here to do it right"). Price point is budget-to-mid ($10-20/person). There is enormous untapped potential here: a chain with nearly 2,000 weekly marketplace orders and only 133 Instagram followers represents a massive engagement gap.

## 2. Playwright-Verified Environment Color Table

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Falafel Corner's Instagram posts are almost entirely AI-generated promotional flyers, NOT photos taken inside their actual restaurants. The pixel data below reflects the designed flyer backgrounds, not real restaurant interior colors. This is an important distinction for Agent 3: the "environment" for this brand is the designed flyer aesthetic, not a photographed restaurant setting.

| Element | Color Name | Hex Code | Source (Post # / Region) | Verified Across | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Primary flyer background | Warm amber/burnt orange gradient | #b05e03 to #a33004 | Post 2 topLeft (#b05e03), Post 2 topRight (#a33004), Post 3 topLeft (#b1350e) | Posts 2, 3, 4 (6 of 12 posts) | Dominant across product promo flyers |
| Secondary flyer background | Warm beige/cream | #fbe2ba to #ffebc6 | Post 1 topLeft (#fbe2ba), Post 1 topCenter (#ffebc6), Post 1 bottomLeft (#ffebc5) | Post 1 (Shawarma Fries flyer) | Used for lighter-themed flyers |
| Falafel Friday background | Deep crimson red | #660711 to #910111 | Post 6 topLeft (#660711), Post 6 topCenter (#910111) | Post 6 only | Dark red background for "Falafel Friday" promo |
| Holiday/white background | Clean white | #ffffff | Post 7 topRight (#ffffff), Post 8 topLeft (#ffffff), Post 9 topLeft (#ffffff) | Posts 7, 8, 9 (4th of July themed) | Used for patriotic/holiday-themed content |
| Bacon Cheese Burger bg | Warm peach/sand | #e8c9b7 to #e9d2c0 | Post 10 topLeft (#e8c9b7), all edges (#e9d2c0) | Post 10 only | Soft warm background for burger promo |
| Chicken Wrap bg | Warm cream/ivory | #fef5ea to #fff7ec | Post 11 topLeft (#fef5ea), Post 11 topCenter (#fff7ec) | Post 11 only | Light warm background |
| Brand red (logo) | Deep red/maroon | #AD2429 | Website H2 headings: rgb(173, 36, 41) | Logo, website, throughout | Primary brand color |
| Brand orange (CTA) | Terracotta orange | #D2482B | Website buttons/links: rgb(210, 72, 43) | Website nav, buttons, CTAs | Secondary brand color |
| Food center tones | Golden-brown food colors | #d2a586 to #bb8249 | Post 0 center (#d2a586), Post 2 center (#bb8249), Post 3 center (#84502c) | Throughout food imagery | Natural food photography tones |

**IMPORTANT FOR AGENT 3:** Since no real restaurant interior photos exist on the feed, prompts should use the warm amber/orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as the primary background for product promos, the warm beige/cream (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) for lighter-themed content, and clean white (#ffffff) for holiday/seasonal posts. The brand red (#AD2429) and brand orange (#D2482B) should be used for text accents and CTAs.

## 3. Visual System Blueprint

### A. Overall Aesthetic Category
**Primary:** Corporate clean (designed flyers, not organic food photography)
**Secondary:** Bold & colorful (warm amber/orange palette dominates)

### B. Color Palette
- **Dominant colors:** Warm amber-to-burnt-orange gradient backgrounds (observed in posts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), deep crimson red (post 6 Falafel Friday), clean white (posts 7-9 holiday content), warm beige/cream (posts 1, 10, 11)
- **Accent colors:** White text, brand red (#AD2429), brand orange/terracotta (#D2482B)
- **Background style:** Solid gradient (warm amber to burnt orange) -- NOT natural backgrounds. These are designed flyers, not restaurant photography
- **Is the feed color-consistent?** YES -- remarkably consistent. Almost every post uses the same warm amber/orange gradient or a variation of it. The exceptions are holiday-themed posts (white backgrounds) and the Falafel Friday promo (deep crimson red). The consistency comes from a templated design approach.

### C. Image Composition Patterns (from STATIC PHOTO posts -- all are designed flyers)
- **Recency:** The most recent post is October 17, 2025 (catering containers -- the only real photo). All other visible posts are from June-July 2024. The feed has been largely inactive for 15+ months.
- **Camera angle breakdown:** N/A -- these are NOT photographs. They are AI-generated or stock food imagery placed into designed flyer templates. The food hero images within the flyers use approximately:
  - 60% eye-level / 45-degree views of dishes
  - 30% overhead-style (flat bowl shots)
  - 10% angled close-ups
- **Close-up / wide shot ratio:** 100% close-up food hero -- no wide shots, no restaurant interiors, no lifestyle shots
- **Centered subject or asymmetrical?** 85% centered food hero (posts 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11). Roughly 15% have food positioned slightly left-of-center (post 6 Falafel Friday has fries left-shifted)
- **Edge-cropping & dynamic framing:** MINIMAL. Food is almost always fully contained within the frame, sitting on a designed background. The only exception is the Oct 17, 2025 post (real photo of catering containers) which has natural cropping. For AI-generated content matching this feed, food should be fully visible and centered -- edge-cropping would look off-brand.
- **Negative space usage:** Moderate -- flyer backgrounds have ample space for text overlays above and below the food hero
- **Product isolated or contextual?** Isolated. Food appears on designed backgrounds with decorative elements (herb garnishes, vegetable accents, line drawings) but no real-world context (no tables, no restaurant, no hands except one post)
- **People included?** Rarely. One post (Post 3 - Falafel) shows a hand reaching to grab food. Otherwise, no people.
- **Surface/table details:** N/A -- food floats on designed gradient backgrounds, not real surfaces. Exception: Post 0 (Oct 2025) shows food in clear plastic catering containers on what appears to be a dark surface
- **Plate/serving ware style:** In the flyer designs: white ceramic bowls (Post 3 falafel bowl), standard white plates, food presented unwrapped/open. In the real photo (Post 0): clear plastic catering containers with lids
- **Carousel storytelling:** Only Post 0 (Oct 2025) is a carousel -- it appears to show multiple catering items

## 4. Website Typography System (MANDATORY -- Agent 3's Primary Font Reference)

### Headline Font: Oswald
- **Family:** Oswald, sans-serif
- **Weight:** 500 (Medium)
- **Size:** 42px (H2 section headers), 36px (H1 feature headers)
- **Case:** UPPERCASE (text-transform: uppercase)
- **Color:** rgb(173, 36, 41) = #AD2429 (deep red/maroon)
- **How it RENDERS at display size:** Oswald at 42px uppercase renders as a tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width. The letters are narrow and vertically elongated, creating a strong, bold, slightly industrial feel. NOT rounded -- angular and straight-edged. At display size, it reads as authoritative and modern, like a sports brand or fast-casual chain header. The condensed width allows long words like "MEDITERRANEAN" to fit on one line.

### Secondary Headline Font: Bebas Neue
- **Family:** Bebas Neue, sans-serif
- **Weight:** 400 (Regular -- but Bebas Neue only has one weight which reads as bold)
- **Size:** 66px (hero "MEDITERRANEAN GRILL"), 24px (menu item names)
- **Case:** Mixed -- hero text renders in all caps naturally, menu items in title case
- **Color:** White (#FFFFFF) on dark backgrounds, #AD2429 on white backgrounds
- **Letter-spacing:** -0.72px (slightly tightened for menu items)
- **How it RENDERS at display size:** Bebas Neue at 66px reads as an ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font with perfectly uniform stroke weight. It is MORE condensed than Oswald -- letters are very tall and narrow, almost like compressed block letters. There are no lowercase forms. At large sizes, it creates a cinematic, poster-quality feel. The uniformity makes it look engineered and precise, not handmade.

### Body/Secondary Font: DM Sans
- **Family:** DM Sans, sans-serif
- **Weight:** 600 (SemiBold) for navigation, 400 (Regular) implied for body text
- **Size:** 16px (navigation and body paragraphs)
- **Color:** rgb(210, 72, 43) = #D2482B (terracotta orange -- for navigation links), standard dark for body text
- **How it RENDERS:** DM Sans is a clean, geometric sans-serif with slightly rounded terminals. At 16px it reads as modern and approachable -- not as severe as Inter or Helvetica. The semibold weight for navigation gives it a warm, friendly crispness.

### Reviewer Names Font: Inter
- **Family:** Inter, sans-serif
- **Weight:** 700 (Bold)
- **Size:** 16px
- **Color:** rgb(210, 72, 43) = #D2482B (terracotta orange)

### Brand Colors Used in Text
- **Primary headline color:** #AD2429 (deep red/maroon) -- all H1, H2 headings
- **Navigation/link color:** #D2482B (terracotta orange) -- nav items, reviewer names
- **Body text:** Dark gray/near-black (standard readability)
- **Hero text on dark backgrounds:** #FFFFFF (white)

### Button/CTA Style
- **"Order Online" button:** White text (#FFFFFF) on terracotta orange background (#D2482B), font-weight 700 (bold), border-radius 1000px (fully rounded/pill shape), 16px DD-TTNorms font (DoorDash widget)
- **"Order Delivery" / "Order Pickup" buttons:** Same styling as above -- white on #D2482B, pill-shaped
- **The CTA button pattern:** Rounded pill shape, terracotta orange, white bold text

### Overall Typographic Personality
Sans-serif-forward, modern, condensed display type for impact. The combination of Oswald (condensed bold) for section headers and Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed display) for hero/product names creates a FAST-CASUAL CHAIN aesthetic -- clean, efficient, slightly industrial. This is NOT a premium fine-dining type system. It reads as accessible, bold, and corporate.

## 5. Text Overlay Specifications (from REAL posts)

### Does the brand use text on images?
**Always.** Every single post on the feed (except Post 0, the catering photo) has text overlays. This is a flyer-first brand -- text IS the design, not an addition to photography.

### Text Density
**Heavy headline style.** Every flyer has 2-3 levels of text: product name headline, descriptive sub-headline, and "ORDER NOW" CTA.

### Font Styles Observed on Instagram Posts
**NOTE:** Instagram post fonts differ from the website typography. The website is the PRIMARY authority for Agent 3.

**Observed on Instagram flyers:**
- **Product name headline (on flyer):** Mixed approach --
  - Some posts use a decorative script/cursive for product names (Post 1 "Shawarma" in orange script, Post 3 "Double Cheese Burger" in white script, Post 4 "Chicken Wrap" in white block caps)
  - Others use bold block sans-serif for product names (Post 2 "FALAFEL" in white caps)
- **Descriptive sub-headline:** ALL CAPS sans-serif, medium-to-bold weight, white color. Examples: "CRISPY FRIES MEET SHAWARMA GOODNESS!" (Post 1), "GET CHEESY WITH OUR" (Post 3), "The Ultimate Food Indulgence!!!" (Post 2 -- this one in script)
- **CTA:** "ORDER NOW" in ALL CAPS, bold sans-serif, white or bright green, positioned at bottom

**For Agent 3 -- USE WEBSITE FONTS INSTEAD:**
- Headlines: Oswald Medium uppercase (#AD2429 on light backgrounds, #FFFFFF on dark backgrounds)
- Product names: Bebas Neue (#AD2429 or #FFFFFF)
- Sub-headlines/CTA: DM Sans SemiBold
- This will create more brand-consistent content than the varied Instagram flyer fonts

### Text Placement MAP
Based on all text-overlay posts analyzed:
- **TOP of image (10-30% zone):** ~70% of posts. The product name or descriptive headline appears in the top third. Examples: Post 1 "Shawarma FRIES" at top, Post 2 "FALAFEL" at top-left, Post 3 "GET CHEESY WITH OUR / Double Cheese Burger" at top, Post 4 "CHICKEN WRAP" at top-center
- **MIDDLE/CENTER:** ~20% of posts have some text in the center zone, usually overlapping or framing the food hero. Example: Post 2 "The Ultimate Food Indulgence!!!" sits at center-bottom, overlapping the food area
- **BOTTOM of image (70-90% zone):** ~100% of posts have the "ORDER NOW" CTA at the bottom. This is consistent across ALL flyers
- **Split layout (text at top AND bottom):** ~80% of posts use this pattern: Product name at TOP + "ORDER NOW" at BOTTOM, with food hero in the middle

**Summary:** The dominant pattern is a Z-pattern flyer layout with headline text at top, food hero in center, CTA at bottom.

### Text Background Treatment MAP
- **NO background treatment (raw text on gradient):** ~80% of posts. The warm amber/orange gradient background provides natural contrast for white text. No additional overlay, shadow, or box needed.
- **Semi-transparent box/bar:** ~10%. The "GET OFFER" button in the Falafel Friday post (Post 6) uses a small bright green button/badge
- **Drop shadow:** ~10%. Some posts appear to have subtle drop shadows on white text, but this is inconsistent
- **Gradient/vignette overlay:** 0%. NOT used.
- **Solid color background behind text:** 0%. NOT used.

### Text Decoration
- **Falafel Corner logo:** Appears in 70%+ of posts, typically at top-left. The logo features a flame/teardrop shape in red/orange gradient with "FALAFEL CORNER" and "MEDITERRANEAN GRILL" text
- **Decorative elements:** Line drawings of food items (falafel sketches, pita outlines) in the background (~30% of posts), fresh herb/vegetable garnishes as decorative elements scattered around the food hero (~50% of posts)
- **No borders, no frames** around the overall image
- **No stickers or graphic shapes** beyond the logo and food garnish elements

---

## 6. Photography & Editing Profile

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Almost no real photography exists on this feed. The content is designed promotional flyers with either AI-generated or stock food imagery placed into templates.

### The One Real Photo (Post 0 -- Oct 17, 2025)
- **Lighting:** Indoor, overhead/slightly angled, appears to be phone flash or fluorescent -- slightly warm, adequate but not professional
- **Surface:** Dark surface (possibly counter or table), #271a17 (very dark brown/near-black) from pixel data
- **Subject:** Clear plastic catering containers with hummus varieties and pita chips
- **Camera feel:** iPhone casual -- handheld, slightly tilted, not styled
- **Editing:** Minimal -- natural colors, no filters, white text overlay added directly on the photo

### Flyer Food Imagery Style (Posts 1-11)
- **Lighting:** Studio/digital rendering -- even, bright, high-contrast lighting that makes food look vibrant and appetizing. Warm-toned.
- **Editing style:** Ultra crisp, high saturation, warm-toned. Food colors are boosted -- greens are very green, browns are rich, sauces look glossy
- **Background/surface:** Designed gradient backgrounds (warm amber/orange #b05e03 to #a33004). Food either floats on the gradient or sits in styled bowls/plates on the gradient
- **Camera feel:** Digital rendering / stock photography -- NOT iPhone casual, NOT real restaurant environment
- **Dominant camera angle:** ~60% 45-degree view, ~30% slight overhead, ~10% eye-level (for burgers/wraps)

### For Agent 3's Image Prompts
Since the existing feed uses AI-generated food imagery on designed backgrounds, Agent 3 should create prompts that match this aesthetic: studio-quality food hero on warm gradient backgrounds with professional lighting. However, to improve authenticity, Agent 3 could introduce some real-environment elements (food on actual restaurant counters/tables) while maintaining the brand color palette. This would represent an evolution of the brand's visual style toward more authentic content.

## 7. Graphic Design System

- **Use of templates:** YES -- strong templated approach. All flyers follow the same layout formula
- **Repeated design frames:** YES -- warm gradient background + centered food hero + logo top-left + text top + CTA bottom
- **Borders around posts:** NO
- **Watermarks:** NO
- **Logo placement:** Top-left corner in ~70% of posts. The logo includes the flame/teardrop icon and "FALAFEL CORNER / MEDITERRANEAN GRILL" text
- **Consistent layout grid:** YES -- Z-pattern layout:
  1. Logo at top-left
  2. Product name/headline at top (10-30% zone)
  3. Food hero centered (30-70% zone)
  4. Descriptive sub-text at bottom-center (70-85% zone)
  5. "ORDER NOW" CTA at bottom (85-95% zone)
- **Decorative elements:** Line-drawn food sketches in background (falafel outlines, pita shapes) at ~30% opacity, fresh herbs/vegetables as accent garnishes scattered around the food hero
- **Design software indicators:** Content appears to be created with a Canva-like tool or AI flyer generator -- consistent template approach, stock/AI food imagery, standard font pairings

---

## 8. Caption Architecture Guide

### Caption Length
Short -- typically 1-2 sentences plus hashtags. Total caption length is 15-25 words before hashtags. No posts have more than 2 substantive sentences.

### Hook Style
Every caption opens with an emoji pair followed by an imperative or exclamatory statement. Observed hooks:
- "Treat yourself to our Shawarma Fries at Falafel Corner!" (Post 1)
- "Savor the authentic taste of our falafel at Falafel Corner!" (Post 2)
- "Get ready for cheesy goodness with our Double Cheese Burger at Falafel Corner!" (Post 3)
- "Enjoy our mouthwatering Chicken Wrap at Falafel Corner!" (Post 4)
- "Falafel Friday" (Post 5 -- event hook)
- "Get ready for a flavor explosion with our Bacon Cheese Burger at Falafel Corner!" (Post 10)
- "Craving something tasty? Try our chicken wrap at Falafel Corner!" (Post 11)

**Pattern:** [Emoji pair] + [Action verb ("Treat yourself," "Savor," "Get ready for," "Enjoy," "Try")] + [adjective] + [product name] + "at Falafel Corner!"

### Body Structure
One sentence describing the food after the hook sentence. Uses simple adjective stacking. Examples:
- "Crispy fries topped with flavorful shawarma."
- "Crispy, flavorful, and perfect for any meal."
- "Twice the cheese, twice the flavor."
- "Packed with fresh ingredients and bursting with flavor."
- "Juicy, cheesy, and topped with crispy bacon."
- "Packed with fresh ingredients and amazing flavors."

**Pattern:** Short sentence using 2-3 positive adjectives ("crispy," "flavorful," "fresh," "juicy," "cheesy," "mouthwatering," "amazing")

### Emoji Usage
- **Opening:** Always starts with 2 food-related emojis matching the product (e.g., fries+wrap for shawarma fries, burger+cheese for burger, wrap+fire for spicy items)
- **Closing:** Always ends with star+OK-hand (frequently) or star+falafel
- **In-caption:** Minimal -- emojis bookend the caption, rarely appear mid-sentence
- **Count:** 4-6 emojis per post (2 opening + 2-3 closing)

### Line Break Structure
Dense -- single block of text with no line breaks within the caption body. Hashtags appear immediately after the closing emojis, separated only by a space (NOT on a new line). Exception: the Falafel Friday post uses line breaks between the header and the promo details.

### CTA Style
**In captions: NONE.** There is no written call-to-action in any caption. The "ORDER NOW" CTA exists only on the image overlay, not in the caption text. This is a significant weakness -- captions have zero conversion hooks.

### Hashtag Placement
End of caption, inline (not in first comment, not separated by line breaks). Placed directly after the closing emoji pair.

### Hashtag Count Range
3-6 hashtags per post. Extremely low count. Mix of:
- Brand tag: #FalafelCorner (every post)
- Product tag: #ShawarmaFries, #ChickenWrap, #DoubleCheeseBurger, #BaconCheeseBurger
- Generic descriptor: #TastyTreats, #FreshEats, #CheesyDelight, #MiddleEasternEats, #BurgerLovers, #FlavorExplosion
- Promo tags: #free, #discounts (Falafel Friday only)

### Bilingual Elements
None observed. All content is in English only.

### Voice/Personality in Captions
Generic and templated. The brand sounds like a corporate content bot, not a person. Every caption follows the exact same formula. There is no personality, humor, storytelling, or community voice. The captions read as if they were generated by a basic AI tool using a fill-in-the-blank template: "[Emoji] [Action verb] our [Product] at Falafel Corner! [Adjective description]. [Hashtags] [Emoji]"

### Recurring Phrases or Patterns
- "at Falafel Corner!" -- appears in nearly every caption
- "flavor" / "flavorful" / "flavor explosion" -- used in 60%+ of captions
- "crispy" -- used frequently for falafel, fries, bacon
- "fresh ingredients" -- used in wrap descriptions
- Closing emoji pair of star+OK-hand (multiple posts)

---

## 9. Real Caption Examples (MANDATORY -- Verbatim from Instagram)

### Example 1: Shawarma Fries (July 11, 2024)
> Treat yourself to our Shawarma Fries at Falafel Corner! Crispy fries topped with flavorful shawarma. #ShawarmaFries #TastyTreats #FalafelCorner

**Annotations:**
- **Representative because:** Follows the exact template used across ALL posts -- emoji hook, action verb, product name, brand mention, one-sentence description, 3 hashtags, closing emojis
- **Hook type:** Imperative action ("Treat yourself")
- **CTA approach:** NONE in caption. Relies entirely on image overlay "ORDER NOW"
- **Emoji pattern:** Opens with fries+wrap, closes with star
- **Length:** 1 sentence hook + 1 sentence description = ~17 words
- **Tone:** Generic promotional, reads like a template

### Example 2: Falafel (July 10, 2024)
> Savor the authentic taste of our falafel at Falafel Corner! Crispy, flavorful, and perfect for any meal. #Falafel #MiddleEasternEats #FalafelCorner

**Annotations:**
- **Representative because:** Shows the "authentic" angle the brand occasionally uses. Still follows the template exactly
- **Hook type:** Imperative action ("Savor")
- **CTA approach:** NONE
- **Emoji pattern:** Opens with falafel+sparkles, closes with star+OK-hand
- **Length:** 1+1 sentences = ~18 words
- **Tone:** Slightly more elevated ("savor the authentic taste") but still generic

### Example 3: Falafel Friday Promo (July 5, 2024)
> Falafel Friday
> Now get FREE FRENCH FRIES, with the purchase of ANY Wrap!
> .
> .
> #falafelcorner #FlavorExplosion #wrap #fries #free #discounts

**Annotations:**
- **Representative because:** The ONLY post that breaks the caption template. Has a promotional offer, uses ALL CAPS for emphasis, and includes a deal structure. This is the closest the brand gets to actionable promotional content
- **Hook type:** Event/occasion name ("Falafel Friday")
- **CTA approach:** Promotional offer (free fries with wrap purchase) -- the closest thing to a real CTA on the feed
- **Emoji pattern:** Opens with fire+fire, has fries emoji mid-caption, closes with face-savoring
- **Length:** Multi-line with dot separators = structured differently from other posts
- **Tone:** More energetic, promo-forward. The fire emojis and ALL CAPS "FREE FRENCH FRIES" create urgency. This is the best-performing caption style on the feed.

### Example 4: Double Cheese Burger (July 8, 2024)
> Get ready for cheesy goodness with our Double Cheese Burger at Falafel Corner! Twice the cheese, twice the flavor. #DoubleCheeseBurger #CheesyDelight #FalafelCorner

**Annotations:**
- **Representative because:** Shows the playful side of the brand (limited as it is). "Twice the cheese, twice the flavor" is a catchy phrase
- **Hook type:** Exclamatory build-up ("Get ready for")
- **CTA approach:** NONE
- **Emoji pattern:** Opens with burger+cheese, closes with star+OK-hand
- **Length:** 1+1 sentences = ~18 words
- **Tone:** Slightly more fun than average with the "twice" repetition

### Example 5: 4th of July (July 4, 2024)
> Celebrate 4th of July at Falafel Corner! Enjoy delicious food while you honor Independence Day with friends and family. #4thOfJuly #FalafelCorner #CelebrateFreedom

**Annotations:**
- **Representative because:** Shows how the brand handles occasion/holiday content. Generic -- "enjoy delicious food" could be any restaurant. No specific menu item tie-in, no special offer
- **Hook type:** Holiday celebration ("Celebrate 4th of July")
- **CTA approach:** NONE -- "Enjoy delicious food" is passive, not actionable
- **Emoji pattern:** Closes with star+falafel only (no opening emojis)
- **Length:** 1+1 sentences = ~19 words
- **Tone:** Formal/corporate. "Honor Independence Day" is stiff. A huge missed opportunity for a promo or menu-specific angle

---

## 10. Tone & Voice Encoding

### Brand Tone in 3 Words
**Templated, Generic, Promotional**

### Personality Archetype
**The Corporate Menu Board** -- speaks like a standardized fast-food chain press release. No personality, no humor, no warmth, no community voice. Every post could be from any Mediterranean restaurant in the country.

### Words/Phrases Frequently Used (cited from real captions)
- "at Falafel Corner!" (every post)
- "flavor" / "flavorful" / "flavor explosion" (5+ posts)
- "crispy" (4+ posts)
- "fresh ingredients" (3+ posts)
- "Treat yourself" / "Enjoy" / "Savor" / "Get ready for" / "Try" (opening verbs)
- "Packed with" (2 posts)
- "mouthwatering" (1 post)
- "delicious" (1 post)

### Words/Phrases Never Used
- No slang, no abbreviations (no "rn," "ngl," "fr")
- No questions to the audience
- No "you" directed engagement ("tag someone," "tell us," "comment below")
- No local/Sacramento references
- No humor, no wit, no hot takes
- No storytelling, no behind-the-scenes, no personal anecdotes
- No pricing information
- No menu hack suggestions
- No urgency language (except the Falafel Friday post)

### Energy Level
**3/10.** Extremely low energy. Every post reads the same way -- calm, informational, surface-level. Zero scroll-stopping energy. The Falafel Friday post bumps to a 5/10 with its fire emojis and promo language, but that's the ceiling.

## 13. Words to Use / Words to Avoid

### Words to USE (based on brand voice + what resonates with audience)
- "Fresh" (used in real captions -- "fresh ingredients")
- "Crispy" (used in real captions -- describes falafel, fries)
- "Flavorful" (used in real captions)
- "Bold" (from website -- "bold Mediterranean flavor")
- "Stacked" (from website -- "stacked just how you like it")
- "Falafel Corner" (always name the brand -- current pattern)
- "ORDER NOW" / "Order Online" (established CTA language)
- "Halal" (key differentiator -- not currently used in Instagram captions but is a major audience draw per reviews)
- "Mediterranean" (brand identity)
- Location names: "Sacramento," specific neighborhood names for local relevance
- "Free" / deal language (Falafel Friday post style -- the most energetic content they have)

### Words to AVOID
- Corporate language: "leverage," "utilize," "synergy," "curated"
- Overused food influencer terms: "hidden gem," "foodie paradise," "game changer," "you won't believe"
- Generic filler: "delicious" (too vague -- use specific descriptors instead)
- Stiff/formal language: "honor Independence Day" (from real caption -- too formal for Instagram)
- Complex vocabulary -- keep it accessible for the broad, budget-conscious audience
- DO NOT use "at Falafel Corner!" at the end of every single caption -- varies the brand mention placement to avoid the templated feel

## 14. Cultural Moments to Own

### High-Priority (Natural Brand Fit)
1. **Meatless Monday** -- Falafel is vegetarian, gluten-free, and a perfect Meatless Monday hero. Post the falafel wrap/platter every Monday with a "Skip the meat, not the flavor" angle
2. **Falafel Friday** -- Already established in their content. Should be a RECURRING weekly series, not a one-off post
3. **National Falafel Day (June 12)** -- Obvious brand moment. The entire feed should build up to this
4. **Mediterranean Diet Day / Mediterranean Diet Awareness** -- Position falafel as a health-conscious choice
5. **Ramadan / Eid** -- Halal-certified restaurant serving a community that observes Ramadan. Iftar specials, family platters, late-night orders
6. **Lent (Fridays in February-April)** -- Falafel as a meatless Friday option for Christian observers
7. **International Hummus Day (May 13)** -- Natural fit given their new hummus catering menu

### Medium-Priority (Relevant Tie-Ins)
8. **National Gyro Day (September 1)** -- Gyro wraps and bowls are best sellers
9. **National Wrap Day (late March)** -- Wraps are their primary format
10. **Super Bowl / Game Day** -- Shawarma fries, combo platters, catering for watch parties
11. **Back-to-School (August-September)** -- College students at UC Davis and Sacramento State locations
12. **Tax Day (April 15)** -- "Treat yourself" messaging, affordable comfort food
13. **National Fast Food Day (November 16)** -- Position as "fast food done right" -- Mediterranean fast-casual

### Sacramento-Specific Moments
14. **Sacramento Kings game nights** -- "Fuel up before/after the game" at downtown/midtown locations
15. **Farm-to-Fork Week (September)** -- Sacramento's signature food event. Fresh, local ingredients angle
16. **Sacramento Pride (June)** -- Community inclusion, celebrate with bold flavors
17. **Lunar New Year** -- Multi-cultural Sacramento community tie-in (Asian + Mediterranean fusion moment?)

## Data Sources & Verification Notes

- **Instagram data:** All post screenshots, captions, and pixel color extractions were captured via Playwright on February 18, 2026 from https://www.instagram.com/falafelcorner_main/
- **Website data:** Typography system extracted via Playwright computed styles from https://fcorner.com/ on February 18, 2026
- **Review data:** Yelp (973+ reviews at Natomas location, 212+ at Downtown), DoorDash (6,000+ reviews, 4.4 rating), Google Reviews cited on website
- **Pixel color data:** 12 images sampled across 8 regions each (topLeft, topRight, topCenter, leftEdge, rightEdge, center, bottomLeft, bottomCenter). All hex codes in the Environment Color Table are directly from this extraction
- **Assumption flags:**
  - No real restaurant interior photos exist on the Instagram feed -- all environment colors are from designed flyer backgrounds
  - The website gallery images appear to be AI-generated or stock photography, not photos from actual Falafel Corner locations
  - Caption patterns are based on the most recent 12 posts visible without login (spanning Oct 2025 to June 2024). Older posts may differ but were not accessible without authentication
  - The DoorDash weekly average of 1,806 orders suggests the brand has massive market traction despite minimal social media presence -- this is not assumption, it's confirmed data from the merchant roster
