## Week 1: February 18--24, 2026

### 1. Ramadan Begins + Ash Wednesday -- Dual Religious Observance
**Date:** February 18, 2026 (Ramadan Day 1 + Ash Wednesday / start of Lent)
**Why it's relevant:** A rare calendar overlap -- Ramadan and Lent begin on the same day in 2026. Falafel Corner is halal-certified, making it a natural iftar (sunset meal) destination for the Muslim community across Sacramento. Simultaneously, Lent kicks off 40 days of meatless Fridays for Christian observers, and falafel wraps/platters are the perfect meatless option. Sacramento has significant Muslim and Christian populations, and Falafel Corner's 19+ locations make it accessible across the metro. This is a two-audience-for-one-post opportunity.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "One meal. Two traditions. Whether you're breaking fast at sunset or starting Lent, we've got you." Lead with the Falafel Wrap as the hero (vegetarian, halal, fresh) and the Combo Platter for family iftar gatherings. Highlight halal certification prominently -- this is the #1 differentiator reviewers mention. CTA: Order ahead on DoorDash so your meal is ready at sunset. This Ramadan thread can recur throughout the month.

### 2. Chicken Platter Hero -- The One Everyone Orders
**Date:** Friday, February 20, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** The Chicken Platter is Falafel Corner's #1 ordered item on DoorDash across 6,000+ reviews. It's the anchor of the menu -- grilled chicken with char marks, golden seasoned rice, hummus, tzatziki, salata, and warm pita. At under $17, it's a two-meal value play. The brand has never given the Chicken Platter its own dedicated spotlight post -- it always appears as part of a "Combo Platter" alongside gyro. A standalone hero post lets the chicken platter shine and gives the social proof angle a full canvas.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "6,000+ DoorDash reviews and this is still #1. The Chicken Platter." Pure product hero energy -- social proof hook, portion-size flex, value callout. The food does the selling. This is a Friday post timed to capture weekend dinner ordering. CTA: Order the Chicken Platter on DoorDash -- link in bio.

---

### 3. National Tortilla Chip Day -- Pita Chips Counter-Programming
**Date:** Tuesday, February 24, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Falafel Corner's most recent Instagram post (Oct 2025) featured their catering menu with hummus varieties and pita chips -- chipotle hummus, buffalo ranch hummus with fried pita chips. National Tortilla Chip Day is the perfect counter-programming moment to spotlight pita chips as the superior dipping chip. This also introduces followers to the catering/snack side of the menu that the brand is actively expanding.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "National Tortilla Chip Day? Respectfully... pita chips clear." Playful confidence that puts pita chips head-to-head against tortilla chips. Hero the hummus + pita chip spread from the catering menu. This post breaks the brand's current monotone voice and introduces some personality. CTA: Order hummus + pita chips for your next gathering -- DoorDash or catering orders.

---

## Week 2: February 25 -- March 3, 2026

### 4. National Chili Day -- Mediterranean Comfort Counter-Programming
**Date:** Thursday, February 26, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Chili is comfort food, but so is a loaded Gyro Rice Bowl or a Combo Platter stacked with chicken, gyro, rice, salata, tzatziki, hummus, and pita bread ($17.50). Late February in Sacramento can hit the low 50s in the evening -- warm, filling Mediterranean food hits the same comfort spot as chili but with more variety and flavor depth. Falafel Corner's DoorDash reviews consistently mention portion size as a major positive -- "enough food for two meals" energy.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Skip the chili. Load up a Combo Platter instead." Counter-programming play that positions the Combo Platter as Sacramento's best comfort food deal -- chicken, gyro, rice, hummus, pita, the works for under $18. Emphasize the sheer amount of food you get. CTA: Order the Combo Platter on DoorDash -- link in bio.

---

### 5. Sacramento Kings Game Night / NBA Weekend
**Date:** Weekend of February 28 -- March 1, 2026 (Kings regular season home stretch)
**Why it's relevant:** The Sacramento Kings are the hometown NBA team, and game nights drive massive food delivery orders across the metro. Falafel Corner has downtown Sacramento and midtown-adjacent locations -- literally blocks from Golden 1 Center. Their Combo Platters and Shawarma Fries are built for group watching. With 1,806 weekly DoorDash orders already, this audience is proven delivery-first. The brand should own "game night food" in Sacramento the way pizza chains do nationally.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Kings game tonight? Combo Platter. Shawarma Fries. Gyro Wraps. That's the starting lineup." Position Falafel Corner as THE game-night food order in Sacramento. Hero a spread of platters and fries laid out like a watch-party table. Mention proximity to Golden 1 Center for the downtown location. CTA: Order the game-night spread on DoorDash -- ready before tip-off.

---

### 6. National Cold Cuts Day -- Gyro & Shawarma Spotlight
**Date:** Tuesday, March 3, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** National Cold Cuts Day is a food holiday that naturally connects to Falafel Corner's carved gyro and shawarma meats. Unlike deli cold cuts (pre-packaged, processed), gyro and shawarma are spit-roasted, freshly carved, and halal. This is a credibility play -- elevate the brand's meat quality narrative. DoorDash reviews frequently praise the gyro meat quality specifically ("the gyro is incredible," "best gyro in Sacramento").
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Our 'cold cuts' are carved off the spit, not pulled from a package." Hero the Gyro Wrap with a focus on the freshly carved meat. This post positions Falafel Corner's protein quality above standard deli/fast-food competitors. Lean into the reviewer quotes about gyro quality. CTA: Order a Gyro Wrap or Gyro Rice Bowl -- link in bio.

---

## Week 3: March 4--10, 2026

### 7. Rice Bowl Lineup -- Menu Discovery
**Date:** Wednesday, March 4, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Falafel Corner offers Rice Bowls (Chicken, Gyro, Falafel) that most followers don't know about. The brand's Instagram has never featured bowls -- every post is either a wrap or a platter. Rice bowls are a massive trend in fast-casual dining, and FC's bowls are a lighter, cleaner option for lunch: pick your protein, golden seasoned rice, tzatziki. Under $14. This is a menu discovery post designed to expand what people associate with Falafel Corner beyond wraps and platters. Bowls appeal to the health-conscious, meal-prep, and lunch-ordering segments that are underserved by the current content.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Not a wrap person? We do bowls." Introduce the three-bowl lineup (Chicken, Gyro, Falafel Rice Bowl) with the Chicken Bowl as the hero. Position bowls as the easy, clean, midweek lunch order. This is a menu discovery play -- surprise followers with a product category they didn't know existed. CTA: Order a Rice Bowl on DoorDash -- link in bio.

---

### 8. International Women's Day -- Community Post
**Date:** Sunday, March 8, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Falafel Corner is a franchise operation with 19+ locations -- there are women owners, managers, and team members across the Sacramento metro running these stores daily. International Women's Day is a chance to humanize the brand beyond food flyers and show the people behind the counter. The current feed has ZERO people content (only one hand visible across all posts). This is the post that introduces a human element. Sacramento's diverse community responds well to inclusive, people-first content.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "The women who keep Falafel Corner running. Every. Single. Day." Feature real team members -- even a simple photo of women staff at a location with a genuine thank-you caption. This breaks the AI-flyer mold entirely and introduces authenticity. Keep it warm, not corporate. No sales CTA needed -- this is a community/brand-building post. Optional soft CTA: "Stop by your nearest Falafel Corner and show some love today."

---

### 9. National Meatball Day -- Falafel = The OG Plant-Based Meatball
**Date:** Monday, March 9, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Falafel is literally a chickpea ball. It is the original plant-based meatball -- centuries before Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods existed. National Meatball Day is a perfect creative hook to reframe falafel for audiences who might not think of it that way. This plays to both the foodie audience (fun food-nerd angle) and the health-conscious/vegetarian audience (plant-based hero). Falafel Corner's falafel is also gluten-free (garbanzo beans, not flour-based), adding another health hook.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "The OG plant-based meatball. Crispy. Gluten-free. Been here for centuries." Reframe falafel through the #NationalMeatballDay hashtag to reach new audiences. Show the falafel cross-section (golden-brown crust, green herb interior). This is a Meatless Monday + National Meatball Day double play since March 9 falls on a Monday. CTA: Order your meatless meatballs -- Falafel Wrap, link in bio.

---

## Week 4: March 11--17, 2026

### 10. National Potato Chip Day -- Shawarma Fries Counter-Programming
**Date:** Saturday, March 14, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Another counter-programming opportunity in the same vein as Tortilla Chip Day. Potato chips are fine. But Shawarma Fries -- crispy fries loaded with carved shawarma, drizzled with tahini and tzatziki -- are a completely different tier. This keeps the Shawarma Fries visibility high in the feed (they're one of the most unique and photogenic items on the menu) and rides a trending food hashtag to reach new followers.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Potato chips are a snack. Shawarma Fries are an experience." Short, punchy, confident. Hero the Shawarma Fries dripping with sauce and loaded with meat. This continues the brand's counter-programming voice that pushes FC's menu items as the upgrade to everyday foods. CTA: Order Shawarma Fries on DoorDash -- link in bio.

---

### 11. March Madness Selection Sunday
**Date:** Sunday, March 15, 2026 (Selection Sunday -- brackets revealed at 3pm PT)
**Why it's relevant:** March Madness is the biggest sports-viewing event of March, and Selection Sunday is when bracket fever peaks. Sacramento doesn't have a massive college basketball culture, but everyone fills out brackets, and the game-day food ordering spike is nationwide. Falafel Corner's Combo Platters are literally built for group ordering -- chicken, gyro, salad, rice, hummus, pita all on one platter. With 19+ locations across the metro, they can serve every neighborhood's watch party.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Your bracket's already wrong. Your food order doesn't have to be. Combo Platters for the whole crew." Lean into the universal truth that brackets bust early. Position the Combo Platter as the group-order play for Selection Sunday. Mention catering options for bigger gatherings. CTA: Order your Selection Sunday platter on DoorDash or call for catering.

---

### 12. St. Patrick's Day + March Madness First Four
**Date:** Tuesday, March 17, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** St. Patrick's Day is a top-5 social media day in March. Falafel is famously GREEN on the inside -- fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro) give the interior that vibrant green color. This is a natural, playful visual hook: "The greenest thing you'll eat today." Simultaneously, March Madness First Four games tip off, doubling the food-ordering energy. Sacramento's diverse population doesn't need an "Irish" angle -- the green color hook is universal and fun.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Forget green beer. Falafel is ACTUALLY green. Happy St. Patrick's Day." Show the falafel cut in half to reveal the vibrant green interior. This is a scroll-stopping visual -- most people don't know falafel is green inside. Tie in March Madness: "Green falafel + First Four games = Tuesday sorted." CTA: Order your green falafel on DoorDash today.

---

## Week 5 (Partial): March 18--20, 2026

### 13. March Madness First Round + Nowruz + Eid al-Fitr
**Date:** Thursday, March 19, 2026 (NCAA First Round Day 1) / Friday, March 20, 2026 (Nowruz -- Persian New Year / Expected Eid al-Fitr -- end of Ramadan)
**Why it's relevant:** This is a triple-occasion moment hitting three of Falafel Corner's core audience segments simultaneously:

**March Madness First Round (March 19-20):** 16 games over two days, afternoon tip-offs, peak delivery ordering. This is the payoff after the Selection Sunday teaser. Combo Platters and Shawarma Fries for every game.

**Nowruz / Persian New Year (March 20):** Sacramento has a significant Iranian/Persian community, and Nowruz is a major cultural celebration. Mediterranean food shares deep culinary roots with Persian cuisine -- rice, herbs, grilled meats, tahini, yogurt sauces. Acknowledging Nowruz shows cultural awareness and connects with a core customer base.

**Eid al-Fitr / End of Ramadan (~March 20):** The expected date for Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan's month of fasting. For the halal-observant community that has been ordering iftar meals from Falafel Corner all month, this is the celebration post. Family platters, catering orders, and a genuine "Eid Mubarak" from the brand.

**Suggested campaign angle (two posts):**

**Post A -- March Madness First Round (March 19):** "16 games. 1 order. Combo Platter + Shawarma Fries -- your tournament survival kit." Full game-day energy. Hero a spread of food for a watch party. CTA: Order your March Madness spread on DoorDash.

**Post B -- Nowruz / Eid Celebration (March 20):** "Happy Nowruz! Eid Mubarak! From our Falafel Corner family to yours -- wishing you joy, health, and great food. Halal. Always." This is a genuine community post. Acknowledge both celebrations respectfully. Mention halal certification. Keep it warm. CTA: Celebrate with family platters -- order on DoorDash or call for catering.

## Recurring Content Hooks

### Falafel Friday (Every Friday)
**Why it's relevant:** The brand has already posted one "Falafel Friday" promo (the strongest-performing caption on their feed -- fire emojis, ALL CAPS, free fries with wrap purchase). This should become a WEEKLY recurring series with a standing deal or spotlight. Falafel Friday is the brand's best existing content idea -- it just needs consistency.
**Suggested campaign angle:** Rotate between: (1) a weekly deal (free fries with falafel purchase), (2) a falafel product spotlight (different preparations each week), (3) a "Falafel Friday" challenge/engagement hook ("How many falafels can you eat?"). The key is making Falafel Friday a recognized weekly event across all 19+ locations.

### Meatless Monday (Every Monday)
**Why it's relevant:** Falafel is vegetarian and gluten-free. Meatless Monday is a massive cultural movement with strong hashtag volume (#MeatlessMonday has billions of impressions). Falafel Corner is uniquely positioned because their HERO ITEM is already meatless -- no substitution, no compromise. This is a weekly touchpoint to reach health-conscious and plant-based audiences.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Meatless Monday at Falafel Corner. The falafel wrap has been plant-based since forever." Weekly spotlight on the Falafel Wrap, rotating the visual angle (close-up of the wrap, cross-section of falafel, full platter spread). This builds a consistent Monday content rhythm.

## Strategic Notes

**Recurring Themes Across the 30 Days:**
- **Counter-Programming (3 posts):** Tortilla Chip Day, Chili Day, Potato Chip Day -- these inject the confident personality the brand currently lacks by saying "our thing beats that thing"
- **Game Day Energy (3 posts):** Kings weekend, Selection Sunday, March Madness First Round -- builds "Falafel Corner = game day food" in Sacramento
- **March Madness Arc (2 posts):** Selection Sunday teaser --> First Round payoff. Mirrors the pre-occasion / day-of framework.
- **Ramadan Thread:** The Ramadan opening post can be referenced throughout the month in Stories or as a recurring "iftar pick" series, keeping halal visibility high for the full 30 days until Eid al-Fitr on March 20
- **Chicken Platter Hero (Feb 20):** Standalone product spotlight for the #1 DoorDash order -- social proof + value play
- **Meatless Monday + National Meatball Day (March 9):** Calendar overlap that creates a perfect double occasion for falafel's plant-based credentials
- **Community / Cultural (3 posts):** Ramadan/Ash Wednesday, International Women's Day, Nowruz/Eid -- humanize a brand that currently has zero personality or community connection
- **Menu Discovery (3 posts):** Tortilla Chip Day (hummus + pita chips from catering menu), Cold Cuts Day (gyro/shawarma quality), and Rice Bowl Lineup (bowls as a distinct category) expand what followers associate with Falafel Corner beyond just falafel wraps
- **Local Sacramento Hooks:** Kings game nights and references to specific neighborhoods/locations differentiate from the current generic, could-be-any-city content

**Biggest Strategic Opportunity:**
Falafel Corner has 1,806 weekly DoorDash orders but only 133 Instagram followers. The gap between market traction and social presence is the largest in the entire merchant dataset. Every occasion post should include a DoorDash ordering CTA because the audience is already delivery-first. The goal isn't to change behavior -- it's to put a brand personality behind the orders they're already making.

**Tone Evolution:**
The current brand voice is a 3/10 energy level with zero personality. These occasions are designed to introduce: (1) confident counter-programming energy, (2) Sacramento-specific local pride, (3) cultural awareness for the diverse halal/Mediterranean/Persian community, and (4) engagement hooks that actually ask the audience to respond. The shift should feel like Falafel Corner hired a real social media manager, not like the brand personality changed overnight.

**Falafel = Green Inside (Visual Unlock):**
The St. Patrick's Day post introduces a visual hook that could become a signature content piece: the falafel cross-section showing its vibrant green herb interior. Most people don't know falafel is green inside. This is a scroll-stopping reveal that works beyond St. Patrick's Day -- it can become a recurring visual motif that differentiates Falafel Corner's content from every other food brand.
