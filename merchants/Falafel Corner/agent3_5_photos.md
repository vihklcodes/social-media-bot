## Occasion 1: Ramadan Begins + Ash Wednesday -- Dual Religious Observance
**Hero Food Item:** Combo Platter (chicken, gyro, rice, hummus, salata, pita)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Platters/Platter Chicken/14.png`
**Rationale:** Overhead chicken platter on a solid red background -- grilled chicken pieces, rice, pita, cucumber, tomato, red onion, hummus, lettuce. Red background blends naturally with the brand's deep crimson (#660711) text zone and warm amber food zone. All platter components visible. 45-degree angle matches prompt spec.

## Occasion 2: Chicken Platter Hero -- The One Everyone Orders
**Hero Food Item:** Chicken Platter (grilled chicken, rice, hummus, salata, tzatziki, pita)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Platters/Platter Chicken/14.png`
**Rationale:** Overhead chicken platter on solid red background -- grilled chicken pieces with char marks, rice, pita, cucumber, tomato, red onion, hummus, lettuce. Red background integrates perfectly with the brand's warm amber gradient. All platter components visible. Matches the 30-degree overhead-leaning angle in the prompt. Note: same photo as Occasion 1 but used in a different layout (Golden Ratio Split vs. inverted Golden Ratio Split) so Gemini will generate distinct outputs.

## Occasion 3: National Tortilla Chip Day -- Pita Chips Counter-Programming
**Hero Food Item:** Hummus bowl with pita chips
**Match Status:** NO_MATCH
**Photo Path:** None
**Rationale:** No pita chip or hummus bowl photos in the library. Agent 4 should use text-only generation.

## Occasion 4: National Chili Day -- Mediterranean Comfort Counter-Programming
**Hero Food Item:** Combo Platter (30-degree overhead angle)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Platters/Platter combo/1.png`
**Rationale:** Overhead combo platter on dark plate -- grilled chicken, rice, pita, cucumber, tomato, red onion, tzatziki, hummus. Clean overhead angle closely matches the 30-degree overhead spec. All platter components visible. Different platter photo than Occasion 1 for visual variety (dark plate vs. red background).

## Occasion 5: Sacramento Kings Game Night
**Hero Food Item:** Gyro Wrap + Shawarma Fries spread (45-degree)
**Match Status:** PARTIAL_MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Wrap/Wrap Gyro/25.png`
**Rationale:** Clean 45-degree angle gyro wrap showing sliced gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki drizzle inside warm pita. Dark background, food centered. Covers the primary gyro wrap component of the spread but not the full multi-item layout (Shawarma Fries, second wrap). **Improved from previous run** -- now using an actual gyro wrap photo instead of just shawarma fries.

## Occasion 6: National Cold Cuts Day -- Gyro & Shawarma Spotlight
**Hero Food Item:** Gyro Wrap (eye-level, sliced to show cross-section)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Wrap/Wrap Gyro/2.png`
**Rationale:** Eye-level open pita with prominently displayed sliced gyro meat -- the layered, seasoned texture of spit-roasted meat is clearly visible. Lettuce, tomato, red onion, generous tzatziki drizzle. The frontal angle shows the meat quality and wrap height, matching the prompt's "eye-level angle shot... prominently shows thinly sliced gyro meat." **Upgraded from NO_MATCH** -- gyro wrap photos were completely unavailable in the previous library.

## Occasion 7: Rice Bowl Lineup -- Menu Discovery
**Hero Food Item:** Chicken Rice Bowl (45-degree hero, with Gyro and Falafel bowls as supporting)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Bowls/Chicken Bowl/15.png`
**Rationale:** 45-degree Chicken Rice Bowl in a dark ceramic bowl on a SOLID RED BACKGROUND -- grilled chicken pieces with char marks over golden seasoned rice, generous tzatziki drizzle, diced red onion, cilantro garnish. Red background integrates perfectly with the brand's warm amber gradient. Bowl is generous and overflowing. The dark ceramic bowl on red background creates a modern, clean look that visually distinguishes bowls from the white-plate platter posts. Exact menu item match with correct angle.

## Occasion 8: International Women's Day -- Community Post
**Hero Food Item:** Falafel Wrap (being assembled, 45-degree)
**Match Status:** PARTIAL_MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Wrap/Wrap Falafel/1.png`
**Rationale:** 45-degree angle falafel wrap showing golden-brown falafel balls, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and sauce inside warm pita. Clean studio composition. Dark background. **Improved from previous run** -- now using an actual falafel wrap photo instead of falafel platter. Still PARTIAL because the prompt specifically asks for hands assembling the wrap (a human element), which no product photo can provide. Agent 4 should use this as food reference but rely on text-only for the hands/assembly element.

## Occasion 9: National Meatball Day + Meatless Monday Double Play
**Hero Food Item:** Falafel balls (cut in half, 45-degree close-up)
**Match Status:** PARTIAL_MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Appetizer/Side of Falafel/15.png`
**Rationale:** 4-5 golden-brown falafel balls on a gray plate with lettuce, cucumber, and tzatziki drizzle -- on a SOLID RED BACKGROUND that matches the brand's deep crimson (#660711). Some falafel appear cut showing hints of the herb interior. Red background will integrate naturally with the deep crimson poster background. Partial because the prompt specifically asks for a tight close-up of the vibrant GREEN herb interior cross-section, which isn't prominently featured in this shot.

## Occasion 10: National Potato Chip Day -- Shawarma Fries Counter-Programming
**Hero Food Item:** Shawarma Fries (30-degree overhead)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Mediterranean Fries/Shawarma Fries/5.png`
**Rationale:** Loaded shawarma fries bowl -- 45-degree angle close enough to the 30-degree overhead spec. Golden crispy fries topped with carved chicken shawarma, drizzled with white sauce, diced tomatoes, cilantro garnish. Warm lighting. Correct menu item with all toppings visible. Shawarma Fries folder has 40+ alternatives if Agent 4 needs variety.

## Occasion 11: Selection Sunday -- March Madness Brackets
**Hero Food Item:** Multi-item spread (Combo Platter, wraps, Shawarma Fries, hummus)
**Match Status:** PARTIAL_MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Platters/Platter Chicken/14.png`
**Rationale:** Using overhead chicken combo platter as primary reference -- covers the centerpiece item of the spread. Prompt describes a full 5-item spread (platter, two wraps, shawarma fries, hummus) arranged as a feast frame, which no single photo can capture. Red background provides strong brand integration. Partial match on the platter component only.

## Occasion 12: St. Patrick's Day + March Madness First Four
**Hero Food Item:** Falafel balls (4-5 balls, some cut in half, eye-level close-up)
**Match Status:** PARTIAL_MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Appetizer/Side of Falafel/10.png`
**Rationale:** Eye-level shot of 4-5 golden-brown falafel balls on a dark plate with lettuce, cucumber, and generous tzatziki drizzle on warm wooden table. Some falafel appear to show interior texture. Eye-level angle matches the prompt spec. Different photo than Occasion 9 for visual variety (warm wood table vs. red background). Partial because prompt emphasizes the VIBRANT GREEN herb interior as the St. Patrick's Day visual hook, which isn't prominently visible.

## Occasion 13A: March Madness First Round
**Hero Food Item:** Tournament spread (Combo Platter, Shawarma Fries, wraps)
**Match Status:** PARTIAL_MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Platters/Platter combo/1.png`
**Rationale:** Overhead combo platter on dark plate as the primary hero of the tournament spread. Prompt describes a full 4-item spread but the platter is "center-left" as the anchor. Different platter photo than Occasions 1/11 for variety. Partial match on the platter component only.

## Occasion 13B: Nowruz + Eid al-Fitr -- Community Celebration
**Hero Food Item:** Celebratory family Combo Platter with sides (45-degree)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Platters/Platter Chicken/14.png`
**Rationale:** Overhead chicken platter on red background with all components visible -- chicken, rice, pita, cucumber, tomato, onion, hummus. Red background provides warm, celebratory feel that matches the occasion. The prompt describes a single hero platter (with small side plates), so this platter-focused photo is a strong match. Note: same photo as Occasion 1 (Ramadan opener) -- this creates intentional bookend symmetry between the campaign's opening Ramadan post and closing Eid celebration.

## Occasion 14: Falafel Friday (Recurring Weekly)
**Hero Food Item:** Falafel Wrap (45-degree, fully assembled)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Wrap/Wrap Falafel/22.png`
**Rationale:** Falafel wrap on a WARM AMBER/ORANGE/RED background -- golden-brown falafel balls visible inside warm pita with lettuce, tomato, and spices scattered around. The warm background naturally blends with the brand's amber gradient and deep crimson Falafel Friday color scheme. This is the best brand-integration photo in the entire falafel wrap set. Food is centered and fully visible. **Upgraded from PARTIAL_MATCH** (previously matched to falafel platter).

## Occasion 15: Meatless Monday (Recurring Weekly)
**Hero Food Item:** Falafel Wrap (45-degree, cut in half)
**Match Status:** MATCH
**Photo Path:** `/Users/vickie.hua/Documents/cursor social media/merchants/Falafel Corner/Total New Images Merged/Total New images/Wrap/Wrap Falafel/15.png`
**Rationale:** Open pita/wrap with prominent golden falafel balls, generous white tzatziki drizzle, diced tomato, sliced red onion, cucumber. Steam rising suggests freshness. 45-degree angle, dark background. The green of the falafel and fresh vegetables is vivid, communicating the "healthy, plant-based" energy the Meatless Monday prompt requires. Different wrap photo than Occasions 2, 8, and 14 for visual variety. **Upgraded from NO_MATCH** (previously skipped to avoid reusing the same falafel platter photo).
