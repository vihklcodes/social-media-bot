Some prompts in this campaign introduce real-environment elements (food on actual counters/tables) to evolve the brand toward more authentic content while maintaining the brand color palette.

## Occasion 1: Ramadan Begins + Ash Wednesday -- Dual Religious Observance
**Date:** February 18, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Golden Ratio Split (inverted: 38% text zone on top, 62% food below) -- the top 38% features the headline and Ramadan greeting over a deep crimson (#660711) background, and the bottom 62% showcases a generous Combo Platter as the iftar hero. This split communicates reverence first (the greeting zone is uncluttered and respectful), then abundance (the food zone overflows with halal options). The clear separation between message and food feels intentional for a cultural/religious occasion -- less like a promo flyer, more like a community announcement paired with a feast.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle hero shot of a loaded Combo Platter -- grilled chicken strips and sliced gyro meat arranged side by side over a bed of golden seasoned rice, with a generous scoop of creamy hummus, a mound of fresh salata (diced tomato, cucumber, parsley), a dollop of white tzatziki, and two triangular pita bread slices leaning against the bowl rim. White ceramic bowl. The platter fills the entire bottom 62% of the canvas, centered, fully contained within frame. Beside the bowl, a small portion of golden-brown falafel balls (3-4) on a separate small white plate, showing the vegetarian option.
>
> **Environment:** Deep crimson background (#660711) in the top 38% text zone -- matching the Falafel Friday deep red background from the existing feed. Warm amber gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) fills the bottom 62% food zone, providing the familiar brand backdrop behind the Combo Platter. White ceramic bowl sits on the gradient background. Warm, bright lighting on food -- high-saturation, studio-quality.
>
> **Color palette:** Deep crimson (#660711) for the text zone background, transitioning into warm amber/burnt orange (#b05e03 to #a33004) behind the food. Combo Platter features golden rice, warm brown gyro meat, grilled chicken with char marks, bright white tzatziki, pale beige hummus, vivid green/red salata. Falafel balls are golden-brown (#d2a586 to #bb8249). Brand red (#AD2429) for accent elements. White (#FFFFFF) for all text. The deep crimson top zone creates a solemn, respectful tone that transitions to the warm, abundant food zone below.
>
> **Food styling:** The Combo Platter must look generous and shareable -- this is an iftar (sunset breaking-fast) meal meant for family. Rice is fluffy and golden. Gyro meat is freshly carved with visible seasoning. Chicken has grill marks. Hummus has a pool of olive oil on top with a sprinkle of paprika. Pita bread is warm and slightly puffed. The falafel balls on the side plate are golden and crispy with a hint of the green herb interior visible where one is broken open.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + "FALAFEL CORNER / MEDITERRANEAN GRILL" positioned at top-left corner of the canvas, within the deep crimson zone. White logo on dark red background.
> - **Headline:** "IFTAR READY" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned in the top 38% text zone, centered horizontally, at approximately the 20-30% vertical zone. The deep crimson background (#660711) provides rich, dark contrast for white text -- no overlay needed. Spans ~35% of canvas width (~360px), font height ~70px.
> - **Product callout:** "HALAL COMBO PLATTER" -- Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font, cinematic poster feel, uniform stroke weight), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned directly below the headline with tight spacing. Spans ~30% of canvas width (~310px), font height ~40px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold (clean, geometric sans-serif with slightly rounded terminals), sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside a terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button (matching website CTA style, border-radius: 1000px, 12px horizontal padding). Positioned at the bottom of the text zone (around 35% vertical position), centered. Button spans ~25% of canvas width (~260px), font height ~30px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the deep crimson background (#660711) fills the entire top 38% text zone, providing a solid, uniform dark backdrop. White Oswald and Bebas Neue text at these sizes achieves well above 4.5:1 contrast ratio against the crimson. No overlay needed -- #660711 provides natural contrast.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Subtle line-drawn food sketches (pita outline, falafel circle shapes) at ~20% opacity on the deep crimson background zone, matching the existing feed's decorative style. A few fresh herb sprigs (parsley, mint) scattered around the Combo Platter on the gradient background.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "IFTAR READY" headline on deep crimson (the cultural hook -- immediately signals this post is for Ramadan observers) --> SECOND: Loaded Combo Platter filling the bottom (the feast -- generous, halal, shareable, everything you need to break fast) --> THIRD: Terracotta orange CTA button + falafel on side plate (the action + the vegetarian/Lenten option)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no crescent moon icons, no stickers, no clip art, no full-width gradient overlays. No religious symbols beyond the respectful messaging. Let the food and the halal certification speak.

## Occasion 2: First Lenten Friday -- Meatless Falafel Spotlight
**Date:** Friday, February 20, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- eye enters at the Falafel Corner logo at top-left, sweeps right across the headline "MEATLESS SINCE DAY ONE" in the top 15-25% zone, drops diagonally through the hero falafel wrap cross-section in the center 40-70%, exits at the CTA button in the bottom 10-15%. This is the brand's default flyer layout pattern -- logo top-left, headline top, food hero center, CTA bottom -- which maintains visual consistency with the existing feed while delivering a stronger message. The top headline position works because the claim ("meatless since day one") sets up the reveal of the falafel cross-section below.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle hero shot of a Falafel Wrap cut in half to reveal the cross-section. The cross-section shows 3 golden-brown falafel balls (crispy exterior, vibrant GREEN herb-flecked interior visible on the cut surface), surrounded by shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced red onion, drizzled white tzatziki and tahini sauce, all wrapped tightly in a golden-brown grilled pita bread. The wrap is centered in the frame, fully contained, with the cut face angled toward the camera to showcase the green falafel interior. Below the wrap, a white ceramic plate catches any fallen ingredients.
>
> **Environment:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) fills the background behind the wrap, matching the brand's primary flyer background. White ceramic plate on gradient background. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as dominant background. Falafel exterior is golden-brown (#d2a586 to #bb8249). Falafel INTERIOR is vibrant green (fresh herb color -- parsley, cilantro). Pita is warm golden-brown. Lettuce is vivid green. Tomato is bright red. Tzatziki/tahini are white/off-white. Brand red (#AD2429) for any accent text. White (#FFFFFF) for headline and CTA text.
>
> **Food styling:** The falafel cross-section is THE hero moment -- the green interior must be vibrant and surprising. The wrap should look overstuffed and generous. Sauce drizzles are visible and appetizing. The pita has visible grill marks. This shot communicates "this isn't a sad meatless option -- this is the bestseller."
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner on the warm amber gradient background. White logo.
> - **Headline:** "MEATLESS SINCE DAY ONE" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned in the top 15-25% zone, centered horizontally. The warm amber gradient (#b05e03) provides a solid mid-tone backdrop where white condensed Oswald text reads with strong contrast. No overlay needed -- warm amber (#b05e03) provides natural contrast. Spans ~38% of canvas width (~390px), font height ~65px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold (clean, geometric sans-serif with slightly rounded terminals), sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside a terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Positioned at the bottom 10-15% of canvas, centered. Button spans ~25% of canvas width (~260px), font height ~30px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) fills the entire background, providing consistent warm mid-tone contrast for white text at top and bottom. No overlay needed -- #b05e03 provides natural contrast for white Oswald at >=4.5:1 ratio.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Faint line-drawn falafel ball outlines and herb leaf sketches at ~25% opacity scattered on the gradient background around the wrap hero. A few fresh parsley sprigs placed decoratively beside the plate.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "MEATLESS SINCE DAY ONE" headline (the claim that reframes falafel for Lenten observers) --> SECOND: Falafel Wrap cross-section with GREEN interior visible (the proof -- vibrant, fresh, this is not a compromise) --> THIRD: Terracotta orange CTA button (the action -- order it now)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no clip art, no full-width gradient overlays, no cross or religious symbols. Keep it food-forward.

## Occasion 3: National Tortilla Chip Day -- Pita Chips Counter-Programming
**Date:** Tuesday, February 24, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Asymmetric Hero -- the hummus and pita chip spread is positioned on the right side of the canvas (occupying ~60% of the frame width), while the headline and CTA text occupy the open space on the left side (~40%). This layout breaks from the brand's typical centered Z-pattern to create a more dynamic, modern feel that matches the playful counter-programming energy of this post. The asymmetry creates visual tension -- the food "pushes" into the frame from the right while the bold claim sits confidently on the left.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree overhead-leaning angle shot of a hummus and pita chip spread. A large white ceramic bowl of classic hummus (smooth, with olive oil pool on top, paprika sprinkle, and a few whole chickpeas as garnish) sits center-right. Beside it, a smaller white bowl of chipotle hummus (deeper rust color with a chipotle pepper garnish). Scattered across the right side, golden-brown fried pita chips -- triangular, crispy, some stacked, some flat -- spilling out of a small white bowl or directly arranged on the surface. The spread extends slightly beyond the right edge of the frame, creating abundance. The left 40% of the frame is relatively clear gradient background -- this is the text zone.
>
> **Environment:** Warm beige/cream gradient (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) fills the background -- matching the lighter-themed flyer style from the existing feed (Shawarma Fries post). White ceramic bowls sit on the beige gradient. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm beige/cream (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) as background. Classic hummus is pale beige/tan with golden olive oil. Chipotle hummus is rust/terracotta toned. Pita chips are golden-brown (#d2a586). Brand red (#AD2429) for headline text (dark text on light background). Terracotta orange (#D2482B) for CTA. The lighter background provides a warm, inviting canvas that makes the golden pita chips and rich hummus colors pop.
>
> **Food styling:** The spread should look generous and snackable -- like a catering spread you'd set out for a party. Hummus is smooth with a decorative swirl. Olive oil glistens. Pita chips are perfectly golden and crispy-looking. The chipotle hummus adds visual variety and menu discovery. Some chips should be "dipped" or positioned near the hummus edge to suggest the action of eating.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner on the beige gradient. Brand red (#AD2429) logo (dark on light).
> - **Headline:** "PITA CHIPS CLEAR" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned in the left 40% of the canvas, vertically centered (around 40-55% of canvas height), left-aligned with 60px left margin. The warm beige/cream background (#fbe2ba) provides a clean, light backdrop where deep red Oswald text reads with strong contrast and authority. Spans ~35% of canvas width (~360px), font height ~70px.
> - **Product callout:** "HUMMUS + PITA CHIPS" -- Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font), ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned directly below headline, left-aligned. Spans ~25% of canvas width (~260px), font height ~35px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Positioned below the product callout, left-aligned. Button spans ~22% of canvas width (~225px), font height ~28px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the left 40% of the canvas is clean warm beige/cream gradient (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) with no food elements, creating a wide-open text zone. Brand red (#AD2429) text on beige achieves high contrast without any overlay or treatment. The food is on the right; the text is on the left. Clean separation.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Faint line-drawn pita chip triangle outlines at ~20% opacity on the beige background in the text zone area. A few scattered fresh parsley leaves near the hummus bowls.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Hummus spread with golden pita chips on the right (the visual hero -- golden, abundant, snackable) --> SECOND: "PITA CHIPS CLEAR" headline on the left (the counter-programming hook -- bold red text demands attention) --> THIRD: "HUMMUS + PITA CHIPS" product callout + CTA button (what to order + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no tortilla chip imagery, no comparison graphics, no clip art.

### B. Instagram Caption

## Occasion 4: National Chili Day -- Mediterranean Comfort Counter-Programming
**Date:** Thursday, February 26, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Food-Framed Center -- the Combo Platter is so loaded and abundant that it fills the entire center of the frame, with rice, meat, hummus, salata, and pita extending outward in all directions. The headline sits in a natural clearing at the top center where the warm gradient background is visible above the food. The design intent is immersion: the viewer is looking DOWN into a feast, with the text emerging from the space above the food rather than overlaid on it. The abundance of the platter IS the argument -- you don't need chili when you have THIS.
>
> **Food photography:** Slight overhead angle (about 30-degree tilt) shot of a fully loaded Combo Platter on a large white ceramic plate. The platter features: grilled chicken strips with char marks on one quadrant, freshly carved gyro meat slices on another, a generous bed of golden seasoned rice in the center, a scoop of smooth hummus with olive oil pool, a mound of fresh salata (tomato, cucumber, parsley), a dollop of white tzatziki, and 2-3 triangular pita bread slices arranged at the edge. The plate is centered but the food extends to the edges of the plate generously. Fully contained in frame -- no edge cropping.
>
> **Environment:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) fills the background. White ceramic plate on gradient. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. Golden rice, brown-charred chicken, pink/brown gyro meat, pale beige hummus with golden olive oil, bright green/red salata, white tzatziki, golden-brown pita. Food center tones (#d2a586 to #bb8249) dominate the plate. Brand red (#AD2429) for decorative accents. White (#FFFFFF) for all text.
>
> **Food styling:** This platter must look MASSIVE -- enough food for two meals. The portions should overflow the plate slightly. Rice is fluffy. Chicken has visible grill marks and looks juicy. Gyro meat is freshly carved. Hummus has the classic olive oil/paprika garnish. Every component is distinctly visible and appetizing. This is the "$17.50 that feeds you twice" energy.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner on the warm amber gradient. White logo.
> - **Headline:** "SKIP THE CHILI" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned in the top 15-25% zone, centered horizontally, in the warm amber gradient space above the food. The warm amber gradient (#b05e03) provides a clean, uniform mid-tone backdrop for white text. No overlay needed -- #b05e03 provides natural contrast. Spans ~32% of canvas width (~330px), font height ~65px.
> - **Product callout:** "COMBO PLATTER · $17.50" -- Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned directly below the headline. Spans ~28% of canvas width (~290px), font height ~35px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Positioned at bottom 10-12% of canvas, centered. Button spans ~25% of canvas width (~260px), font height ~30px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the top 15-25% of the canvas is clean warm amber gradient background above the food, providing an uncluttered zone for the headline. The CTA at the bottom sits over the gradient zone below the plate. No overlay needed.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Line-drawn food sketches (rice bowl outline, pita triangle) at ~20% opacity on the gradient background in the top and bottom zones. Fresh herbs scattered on the gradient beside the plate.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Loaded Combo Platter (the overwhelming abundance of food -- chicken, gyro, rice, hummus, salata, pita all visible at once) --> SECOND: "SKIP THE CHILI" headline above (the counter-programming hook reframes what you're looking at) --> THIRD: "$17.50" price callout + CTA button (the value proposition + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no chili bowl imagery, no spoon icons, no clip art.

## Occasion 5: Sacramento Kings Game Night
**Date:** February 28 -- March 1, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- eye enters at the Falafel Corner logo at top-left, sweeps right across the headline "GAME NIGHT LINEUP" in the top 15-25% zone, drops diagonally through the spread of wraps and fries in the center 30-70%, exits at the CTA at the bottom. This is the brand's default layout, appropriate here because game-night content should feel familiar and accessible -- not experimental. The straightforward Z-pattern communicates "this is your game day order" with zero friction.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle shot of a game-night spread on the brand's gradient background. Center: a Gyro Wrap cut in half, revealing the gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, onion, tzatziki, and tahini inside warm pita. To one side: a Chicken Shawarma Wrap, also cut in half, showing the shawarma chicken with pickles and garlic sauce. In front: a generous pile of Shawarma Fries -- golden crispy fries topped with carved shawarma meat, drizzled with tahini and tzatziki. All items in white ceramic plates/bowls. The spread is centered, fully contained.
>
> **Environment:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. White ceramic plates and bowls on gradient. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. Gyro meat is pink/brown, chicken shawarma is golden-brown with char, wraps are golden-brown pita, lettuce is green, tomato is red, sauces are white. Shawarma Fries are golden (#d2a586 to #bb8249) with meat and white sauce drizzle. White (#FFFFFF) for text. Brand red (#AD2429) for accent elements.
>
> **Food styling:** The spread should look like a group order -- multiple items laid out as if friends are about to grab and eat. Wraps are cut to show cross-sections. Shawarma Fries are loaded and saucy. The arrangement should feel casual and abundant, like food laid out for a watch party.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. White logo on gradient.

## Occasion 6: National Cold Cuts Day -- Gyro & Shawarma Spotlight
**Date:** Tuesday, March 3, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Asymmetric Hero -- the Gyro Wrap is positioned on the right side of the canvas (~55% of frame width), cut in half with the cross-section facing the camera. The left side (~45%) holds the headline and text, stacked vertically. The asymmetry creates a "split billboard" effect where the bold claim ("NOT FROM A PACKAGE") and the proof (freshly carved, visible gyro meat) sit side by side. The viewer can't read the text without seeing the food, and vice versa. This layout works for credibility/quality posts where the message and the visual evidence must be seen simultaneously.
>
> **Food photography:** Eye-level angle shot (slightly below 45 degrees -- more frontal to show the wrap's height and filling) of a Gyro Wrap cut in half and stacked slightly. The cross-section prominently shows: thinly sliced gyro meat (pink/brown with visible seasoning and the characteristic layered texture of spit-roasted meat), shredded green lettuce, diced red tomato, sliced white onion, a generous drizzle of white tzatziki sauce, and tahini. Wrapped in warm golden pita bread. The wrap is positioned on the right side of the canvas on a white ceramic plate. A small bowl of extra tzatziki beside the plate.
>
> **Environment:** Warm beige/cream gradient (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) fills the background -- using the lighter palette for this quality-focused post to let the food colors pop without competing with a warm amber background. White ceramic plate on beige gradient. Warm, bright studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm beige/cream (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) as background. Gyro meat is pink/brown with darker charred edges. Pita is warm golden-brown. Lettuce is vivid green. Tomato is bright red. Tzatziki and tahini are white/cream. The lighter background makes the colorful wrap cross-section the undeniable focal point. Brand red (#AD2429) for headline text.
>
> **Food styling:** The gyro meat quality is the hero -- it must look freshly carved, seasoned, and layered (not ground or processed). The wrap should be overstuffed with visible meat. Tzatziki drips slightly. This shot communicates "carved off the spit, not pulled from a package."
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. Brand red (#AD2429) logo on light background.
> - **Headline:** "NOT FROM A PACKAGE" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned on the left 40% of the canvas, vertically centered (~40-55% height), left-aligned with 60px left margin. The warm beige/cream background (#fbe2ba) provides a clean, light backdrop for dark red text. Spans ~32% of canvas width (~330px), font height ~65px.
> - **Product callout:** "GYRO WRAP" -- Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font), ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned directly below headline, left-aligned. Spans ~20% of canvas width (~205px), font height ~35px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Below product callout, left-aligned. Button spans ~22% of canvas width, font height ~28px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the left 40% of the canvas is clean beige/cream gradient with no food, providing an open text zone. Brand red (#AD2429) on beige (#fbe2ba) achieves high contrast. No overlay needed.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Faint line-drawn pita and meat-slice outlines at ~20% opacity on the beige background in the text zone. A parsley sprig near the tzatziki bowl.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Gyro Wrap cross-section on the right (the meat quality -- visible layers, seasoning, freshly carved texture) --> SECOND: "NOT FROM A PACKAGE" headline on the left (the quality claim, read simultaneously with the visual proof) --> THIRD: "GYRO WRAP" product name + CTA button (what to order + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no deli counter imagery, no comparison graphics.

## Occasion 7: National Snack Day -- Shawarma Fries & Sides
**Date:** Wednesday, March 4, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- eye enters at the Falafel Corner logo at top-left, sweeps right across the headline "SNACK RANKING" in the top 15-25% zone, drops diagonally through the loaded Shawarma Fries hero in the center 30-70%, exits at the CTA at the bottom. Top headline placement works because "SNACK RANKING" creates an expectation that the viewer must scroll down through the food to see what's being ranked. The Z-pattern guides the eye through each snack item in the spread.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle hero shot of Shawarma Fries as the dominant item -- a generous pile of golden crispy fries topped with carved chicken shawarma pieces, drizzled with white tahini sauce and possibly a garlic sauce, with pickled turnip/vegetables visible. The Shawarma Fries are in a white ceramic bowl, overflowing. Behind/beside them: a smaller bowl of hummus with golden fried pita chips arranged around it, and a small plate with 3-4 golden falafel balls. The Shawarma Fries dominate center frame. All items centered, fully contained.
>
> **Environment:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. White ceramic bowls and plates on gradient. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. Shawarma Fries are golden (#d2a586) with brown chicken pieces and white sauce drizzle. Hummus is pale beige with golden olive oil. Pita chips are golden-brown. Falafel balls are golden-brown. White (#FFFFFF) for text. The consistent golden tones across all three snack items unify the image.
>
> **Food styling:** Shawarma Fries are the star -- loaded, saucy, piled impossibly high. The chicken pieces are visibly seasoned and carved. Sauce drizzles create appetizing patterns. The hummus and falafel are supporting players that show the breadth of the snack menu. Everything looks fresh and just-served.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. White logo on gradient.
> - **Headline:** "SNACK RANKING" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Top 15-25% zone, centered. Warm amber gradient (#b05e03) provides natural contrast. Spans ~30% of canvas width (~310px), font height ~65px.
> - **Ranking text:** "1. SHAWARMA FRIES  2. HUMMUS + PITA  3. EVERYTHING ELSE" -- Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font), white (#FFFFFF). Positioned directly below headline, centered, each item on its own line. Font height ~28px per line.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Bottom 10-12%, centered. Font height ~30px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- warm amber gradient provides consistent contrast for all white text at top and bottom. The ranking text between headline and food adds a playful structural element unique to this post.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Line-drawn fry and falafel outlines at ~20% opacity on gradient background. Fresh herb garnishes near the bowls.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Loaded Shawarma Fries (golden, saucy, overflowing -- the undeniable scroll-stopper) --> SECOND: "SNACK RANKING" headline + numbered list (the engagement hook -- do you agree with this ranking?) --> THIRD: Hummus + falafel supporting items + CTA (the full snack menu + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no numbered badges, no clip art.

## Occasion 8: International Women's Day -- Community Post
**Date:** Sunday, March 8, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Golden Ratio Split (standard: 62% visual/photo zone on top, 38% text/message zone on bottom) -- the top 62% features warm, inviting food imagery (representing the daily work of the team), and the bottom 38% holds the community message. This layout shifts the brand away from pure product promotion toward community storytelling. The larger food zone maintains brand recognition, while the dedicated text zone below gives the message the space and weight it deserves. This is NOT a sales post -- the layout reflects that by giving more room to the human message.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle shot of a beautifully arranged Falafel Wrap being assembled -- hands (wearing food-service gloves) placing golden falafel balls into a warm pita lined with lettuce, tomato, and sauce. The hands and the food occupy the top 62% of the frame. This is the FIRST time hands/people appear in the brand's content, introducing a human element. The falafel is golden-brown, the pita is warm, the vegetables are vivid. The composition feels warm and personal -- this is food being made with care.
>
> **Environment:** Warm beige/cream gradient (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) fills the entire background -- the lighter palette creates a softer, warmer mood appropriate for a community appreciation post. Warm, bright, natural-feeling lighting (less harsh studio, more warm and inviting).
>
> **Color palette:** Warm beige/cream (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) as background. Falafel is golden-brown (#d2a586). Pita is warm golden. Lettuce is green. Tomato is red. Gloves are light blue or clear. The overall palette is softer and warmer than the usual promo flyer -- intentionally. Brand red (#AD2429) for the text zone.
>
> **Food styling:** The focus is on the HANDS and the CRAFT -- someone making a beautiful wrap with care. The falafel should look perfectly golden. The arrangement should feel like a snapshot of daily work, not a posed product shot.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. Brand red (#AD2429) logo on light background.
> - **Headline:** "EVERY. SINGLE. DAY." -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned in the bottom 38% text zone, centered horizontally, at approximately 70-80% canvas height. The warm beige/cream background (#fbe2ba) provides a clean, light backdrop for deep red text. Spans ~35% of canvas width (~360px), font height ~60px.
> - **Supporting text:** "Thank you to the women who keep Falafel Corner running." -- DM Sans SemiBold (clean, geometric sans-serif with slightly rounded terminals), sentence case, dark gray/near-black (#333333). Positioned below headline, centered. Spans ~50% of canvas width (~515px), font height ~24px. Two lines if needed.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Happy International Women's Day" -- DM Sans Regular, sentence case, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned below supporting text. No button style -- this is a community post, not a sales CTA. Font height ~22px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the bottom 38% of the canvas is clean beige/cream gradient with no food elements, providing an open, respectful zone for the community message. Brand red on beige achieves high contrast.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Minimal -- a few small fresh herb sprigs at the transition between the food zone and text zone. No line-drawn sketches for this post (too playful for the tone). Keep it clean and warm.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Hands assembling the Falafel Wrap (the human element -- first time people appear on the feed, immediately warm and personal) --> SECOND: "EVERY. SINGLE. DAY." headline (the message -- simple, respectful, powerful) --> THIRD: Supporting message + "Happy International Women's Day" (the context and gratitude)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no clip art, no generic "girl power" graphics, no DoorDash CTA on this one. This is a community post, not a sales post.

### B. Instagram Caption

**Variation 1 (Primary -- warm and genuine):**

## Occasion 9: National Meatball Day + Meatless Monday Double Play
**Date:** Monday, March 9, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- eye enters at the Falafel Corner logo at top-left, sweeps right across the headline "THE OG PLANT-BASED MEATBALL" in the top 15-30% zone, drops diagonally through the falafel hero shot in the center 30-70%, exits at the CTA at the bottom. The headline-first approach is critical here because the REFRAMING is the hook -- "plant-based meatball" is the unexpected angle that makes the viewer stop and reconsider falafel. The food below then provides the visual proof.
>
> **Food photography:** Tight 45-degree close-up of falafel balls arranged on a white ceramic plate. One falafel ball is cut in half, prominently showing the VIBRANT GREEN herb-flecked interior (parsley, cilantro, fresh herbs) surrounded by the golden-brown crispy exterior (#d2a586 to #bb8249). Three whole falafel balls beside it, golden and perfectly round. The cut falafel is the hero -- its green interior is the scroll-stopping visual that most people don't expect. A small drizzle of tahini sauce nearby. The arrangement is centered, fully contained.
>
> **Environment:** Deep crimson background (#660711 to #910111) -- using the "Falafel Friday" deep red palette because this post is about FALAFEL as the hero product. The deep crimson creates a dramatic, high-contrast backdrop that makes the golden falafel and green interior POP. White ceramic plate on crimson background. Studio lighting with warm, bright quality.
>
> **Color palette:** Deep crimson (#660711 to #910111) as background. Falafel exterior is golden-brown (#d2a586 to #bb8249). Falafel INTERIOR is vibrant green (the hero color -- fresh herbs). Tahini is pale cream. White (#FFFFFF) for text. The deep red background makes the green interior even more vivid through color contrast (red and green are complementary colors). This is the most dramatic, attention-grabbing color combination in the campaign.
>
> **Food styling:** The cut falafel cross-section is EVERYTHING. The green interior must be vibrant, herb-dense, and visually surprising. The exterior should be perfectly crispy and golden. The whole falafel balls should look uniformly round and golden. This is a "wait, falafel is GREEN inside?" reveal shot.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. White logo on crimson background.
> - **Headline:** "THE OG MEATBALL" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned in the top 15-25% zone, centered. The deep crimson background (#660711) provides rich, dark contrast for white text. No overlay needed -- #660711 provides natural contrast. Spans ~34% of canvas width (~350px), font height ~65px.
> - **Product callout:** "PLANT-BASED · GLUTEN-FREE · HALAL" -- Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned directly below headline, centered, with dots as separators. Spans ~38% of canvas width (~390px), font height ~30px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Bottom 10-12%, centered. Font height ~30px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- deep crimson background (#660711) provides a solid, dark backdrop for white text at top and bottom. Excellent contrast ratio. No overlay needed.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Line-drawn falafel ball outlines and herb leaf sketches at ~25% opacity on the crimson background. A few scattered fresh parsley leaves near the plate.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Cut falafel showing GREEN interior (the reveal -- unexpected, vibrant, scroll-stopping) --> SECOND: "THE OG MEATBALL" headline (the reframing hook that makes the viewer reconsider falafel) --> THIRD: "PLANT-BASED · GLUTEN-FREE · HALAL" credentials + CTA (the health/dietary credentials + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no spaghetti/meatball imagery, no clip art, no full-width gradient overlays.

## Occasion 10: National Potato Chip Day -- Shawarma Fries Counter-Programming
**Date:** Saturday, March 14, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Golden Ratio Split (standard: 62% food on top, 38% text below) -- the top 62% is filled with a dramatic, overflowing shot of Shawarma Fries, and the bottom 38% holds the bold counter-programming headline. This split puts the food first and the message second because the VISUAL of loaded Shawarma Fries is a stronger scroll-stopper than the headline alone. The viewer sees the loaded fries, stops, then reads "Potato chips are a snack. These are an experience." The food does the selling; the text names the feeling.
>
> **Food photography:** Overhead-leaning shot (about 30-degree tilt) of Shawarma Fries in a white ceramic bowl -- a mountain of golden crispy fries buried under carved chicken shawarma pieces with visible seasoning, drizzled with white tahini and garlic sauce in zigzag patterns, topped with a few pickled turnip slices (pink/purple) and a sprinkle of fresh parsley. The bowl is overflowing -- some fries and meat spill slightly over the rim. The image fills the top 62% of the canvas, centered, fully contained.
>
> **Environment:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) fills the entire background. White ceramic bowl on gradient. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting. The gradient transitions to a slightly darker zone at the bottom where the text sits.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. Shawarma Fries are golden (#d2a586 to #bb8249). Chicken shawarma is golden-brown with darker char. Tahini sauce is white/cream. Garlic sauce is white. Pickled turnip is pink/purple (a pop of unexpected color). Parsley is green. White (#FFFFFF) for text.
>
> **Food styling:** These Shawarma Fries must look absolutely LOADED. The fries should be crispy and golden, visible underneath the shawarma. The meat is generous -- more meat than a typical loaded fries order. Sauce drizzles create appetizing patterns. The pickled turnip adds color variety. This should look like something you'd take a photo of before eating.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. White logo on gradient.
> - **Headline:** "FRIES > CHIPS" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned in the bottom 38% text zone, centered horizontally, at approximately 70-75% canvas height. The warm amber gradient in the lower zone (#a33004, slightly darker) provides a solid mid-to-dark tone backdrop for white text. Spans ~28% of canvas width (~290px), font height ~70px.
> - **Product callout:** "SHAWARMA FRIES" -- Bebas Neue (ultra-condensed, tall, all-caps display font), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned directly below headline, centered. Spans ~25% of canvas width (~260px), font height ~38px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Bottom 10-12%, centered. Font height ~30px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the bottom 38% of the canvas is warm amber gradient with no food, transitioning slightly darker. White text reads cleanly against the gradient. No overlay needed.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Line-drawn fry outlines at ~20% opacity in the text zone area. A few fresh herb sprigs near the bottom of the bowl.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Overflowing Shawarma Fries bowl (golden, loaded, saucy -- the ultimate scroll-stopper) --> SECOND: "FRIES > CHIPS" headline (the counter-programming declaration) --> THIRD: "SHAWARMA FRIES" product name + CTA button (what to order + action)

**Date:** Sunday, March 15, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Food-Framed Center -- a spread of items (Combo Platter, wraps, Shawarma Fries) fills the edges and corners of the canvas, creating a natural feast frame around a clearing in the center where the headline sits. The food abundance IS the border, and the text sits within it. This layout communicates "everything you need is here" -- the viewer sees the feast surrounding the message, which reinforces the "sorted" claim. The food frames the text rather than the other way around.
>
> **Food photography:** Slightly elevated 45-degree angle shot of a spread arranged for a watch party. Items radiating outward from center: a Combo Platter (chicken, gyro, rice, hummus, pita) in a large white bowl at the bottom, two halved wraps (Gyro and Chicken Shawarma) on a white plate at the upper left, a bowl of Shawarma Fries at the upper right, and a small bowl of hummus with pita chips at the bottom left. The items create a circular frame around a central clearing where the warm amber gradient is visible. All on white ceramic plates/bowls.
>
> **Environment:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. White ceramic plates and bowls on gradient. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. Full range of food colors: golden rice, brown meats, green lettuce, red tomato, white sauces, golden fries and pita chips, pale hummus. The variety of food colors creates visual richness. White (#FFFFFF) for text.
>
> **Food styling:** This is an abundance shot -- five separate items creating a full-table spread. Each item should look fresh and generous. The arrangement should feel casual, like food just arrived for a party. Everything is full-portioned, not sample-sized.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. White logo on gradient.
> - **Headline:** "BRACKET BUSTED. FOOD ISN'T." -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Positioned in the center clearing of the food-framed composition, approximately at 40-55% canvas height. The warm amber gradient (#b05e03) is visible in the clearing between the food items, providing a mid-tone backdrop for white text. Spans ~40% of canvas width (~410px), font height ~55px. Two lines, centered.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Positioned below the headline in the clearing, centered. Font height ~28px.
> - **Readability:** Food-framed clearing -- the food items naturally surround a clearing where the warm amber gradient is visible. The gradient provides consistent mid-tone contrast for white text. The food frames the text, creating an immersive composition where the viewer reads the message while surrounded by the feast.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Minimal -- the food IS the decoration. A few herb sprigs scattered between items.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Full feast spread surrounding the frame (abundance -- the immediate visual impact of multiple loaded plates) --> SECOND: "BRACKET BUSTED. FOOD ISN'T." headline in the clearing (the relatable hook -- everyone's bracket busts) --> THIRD: Individual items (Combo Platter, wraps, Shawarma Fries, hummus) + CTA (what to order + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no basketball graphics, no bracket imagery, no stickers, no team logos, no clip art.

## Occasion 12: St. Patrick's Day + March Madness First Four
**Date:** Tuesday, March 17, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Asymmetric Hero -- the cut falafel balls showing their GREEN interior are positioned on the left side of the canvas (~55% of frame width), stacked and arranged dramatically. The headline and text sit on the right side (~45%). This layout is deliberately different from the National Meatball Day falafel shot (which used Z-Pattern on crimson) -- the asymmetric approach creates a "gallery wall" feel where the green falafel cross-sections are displayed like specimens, and the text comments on them. The green interior IS the St. Patrick's Day visual hook -- no shamrocks needed.
>
> **Food photography:** Eye-level close-up of 4-5 falafel balls, some whole and some cut in half, arranged in a casual stack/cluster on a white ceramic plate. The cut surfaces face the camera, prominently displaying the VIBRANT GREEN herb interior. The green should be saturated and bright -- this is the visual surprise that stops the scroll. One falafel is positioned mid-bite, showing the crispy golden exterior breaking open to reveal the green. The plate sits on the left side of the canvas.
>
> **Environment:** Warm beige/cream gradient (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) fills the background -- the light background makes the GREEN interior pop dramatically. White ceramic plate on beige gradient. Bright, clean studio lighting that emphasizes the green color.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm beige/cream (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) as background. Falafel exterior is golden-brown (#d2a586 to #bb8249). Falafel interior is VIBRANT GREEN -- the hero color of this post. The contrast between warm beige background, golden exterior, and green interior creates a three-color story that's visually striking and perfectly on-theme for St. Patrick's Day. Brand red (#AD2429) for text accents. White (#FFFFFF) for CTA.
>
> **Food styling:** The green interior is EVERYTHING. Each cut falafel should show a slightly different shade of green depending on the herb density -- some more parsley-green, some more cilantro-tinged. The crispy golden exterior provides contrast. The arrangement should look artisanal and close-up, not like a production shot.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-right corner (mirrored position for this asymmetric layout). Brand red (#AD2429) on light background.
> - **Headline:** "ACTUALLY GREEN" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned on the right 45% of the canvas, vertically centered (~40-50% height), right-aligned with 60px right margin. Warm beige/cream background (#fbe2ba) provides clean contrast for red text. Spans ~30% of canvas width (~310px), font height ~65px.
> - **Supporting text:** "Happy St. Patrick's Day" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, brand red (#AD2429). Below headline, right-aligned. Font height ~24px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Below supporting text, right-aligned. Font height ~28px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the right 45% of the canvas is clean beige/cream gradient, providing an open text zone. Brand red on beige achieves high contrast. No overlay needed.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Faint line-drawn falafel ball outlines at ~20% opacity in the text zone area. A few fresh parsley leaves scattered near the plate edge, reinforcing the "green" theme naturally.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Cut falafel balls showing GREEN interior on the left (the visual reveal -- "wait, it's actually green?" -- the scroll-stopper) --> SECOND: "ACTUALLY GREEN" headline on the right (names what the viewer is seeing, ties to St. Patrick's Day) --> THIRD: "Happy St. Patrick's Day" + CTA (holiday greeting + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no shamrock graphics, no green beer, no leprechaun imagery, no green filters, no basketball graphics. The falafel's natural green IS the St. Patrick's Day element. Let it speak.

## Occasion 13A: March Madness First Round
**Date:** Thursday, March 19, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- eye enters at the Falafel Corner logo at top-left, sweeps right across the headline "TOURNAMENT FUEL" in the top 15-25% zone, drops diagonally through the game-day spread in the center 30-75%, exits at the CTA at the bottom. This is the payoff to the Selection Sunday teaser (Occasion 11) -- same Z-pattern layout as the original game-night post (Occasion 5) to create visual consistency across the sports content arc. The viewer recognizes the layout pattern as "Falafel Corner game day content."
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle shot of a full tournament spread. Center-left: a large Combo Platter in a white ceramic bowl (chicken, gyro, rice, hummus, salata, pita -- the full works). Center-right: a bowl of Shawarma Fries, overflowing. In front: two halved wraps (one Gyro, one Falafel) on a white plate showing their cross-sections. The spread is centered, dense, and abundant -- four items creating a feast layout. Fully contained.
>
> **Environment:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) as background. White ceramic bowls and plates on gradient. Warm, bright, high-saturation studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm amber/burnt orange gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004). Full food color range: golden rice, charred meats, green lettuce/herbs, red tomato, white sauces, golden fries. White (#FFFFFF) for text. The warm, rich palette communicates feast energy.
>
> **Food styling:** Maximum abundance -- this is the "tournament survival kit." Every item is full-portioned and freshly prepared. The Combo Platter is loaded. The Shawarma Fries are overflowing. The wraps show appetizing cross-sections. This spread feeds 3-4 people comfortably.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. White logo on gradient.
> - **Headline:** "TOURNAMENT FUEL" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, white (#FFFFFF). Top 15-25% zone, centered. Warm amber gradient (#b05e03) provides natural contrast. Spans ~32% of canvas width (~330px), font height ~65px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Bottom 10-12%, centered. Font height ~30px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- warm amber gradient provides consistent contrast for white text at top and bottom. No overlay needed.

## Occasion 13B: Nowruz + Eid al-Fitr -- Community Celebration
**Date:** Friday, March 20, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Golden Ratio Split (inverted: 38% text zone on top, 62% food below) -- matching the Ramadan opening post (Occasion 1) to create visual bookend symmetry. The campaign began with a Ramadan greeting and ends with an Eid/Nowruz celebration. The same layout pattern reinforces this arc. The top 38% holds the dual celebration greeting, and the bottom 62% showcases a celebratory family platter. The respectful text zone on top, abundant food below -- the same visual language as the Ramadan opener, but now in celebration rather than anticipation.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle shot of a festive family-sized Combo Platter in a large white ceramic bowl, arranged more elaborately than the usual platter. Grilled chicken strips and gyro meat arranged in a decorative pattern over golden rice, with multiple garnishes: a generous scoop of hummus with olive oil and paprika, fresh salata with extra herbs, white tzatziki, and 4 triangular pita slices fanned around the edge. Next to the main platter, a small plate of 4-5 golden falafel balls, and a small bowl of chipotle hummus with pita chips. The spread is celebratory -- more items, more color, more abundance than a typical single-platter shot.
>
> **Environment:** Warm beige/cream gradient (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) fills the top 38% text zone -- a lighter, more celebratory background than the deep crimson used for Ramadan's somber opening. Warm amber gradient (#b05e03 to #a33004) fills the bottom 62% food zone. White ceramic bowls and plates on the amber gradient. Warm, bright, festive studio lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Warm beige/cream (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) for text zone. Warm amber/burnt orange (#b05e03 to #a33004) for food zone. Full range of food colors: golden rice, grilled meats, green herbs, red tomato/paprika, white sauces, golden falafel and pita chips. Brand red (#AD2429) for headline text on the light zone. White (#FFFFFF) for CTA elements. The overall palette is warm, celebratory, and abundant.
>
> **Food styling:** This is a CELEBRATION platter -- it should look like the best version of Falafel Corner's food. Extra garnishes, extra herbs, extra care in arrangement. The hummus has a decorative swirl. The pita is perfectly golden. The falafel balls are flawless. This is food prepared for a special occasion.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. Brand red (#AD2429) on light background.
> - **Headline:** "EID MUBARAK" -- Oswald Medium (tall, condensed, geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width, vertically elongated, authoritative), ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned in the top 38% text zone, centered horizontally, at approximately 15-22% canvas height. Warm beige/cream background (#fbe2ba) provides clean, light contrast for red text. Spans ~30% of canvas width (~310px), font height ~60px.
> - **Supporting headline:** "HAPPY NOWRUZ" -- Oswald Medium, ALL CAPS, brand red (#AD2429). Positioned directly below "EID MUBARAK" with tight spacing. Same size and treatment. Spans ~30% of canvas width (~310px), font height ~60px.
> - **Body text:** "From our Falafel Corner family to yours. Halal. Always." -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, dark gray (#333333). Positioned below the dual headlines with spacing. Centered. Font height ~22px.
> - **Sub-headline (CTA):** "Order on DoorDash -- link in bio!" -- DM Sans SemiBold, sentence case, white (#FFFFFF) text inside terracotta orange (#D2482B) pill-shaped button. Positioned at the bottom of the text zone (~35%), centered. Font height ~28px.
> - **Readability:** Natural negative space -- the top 38% of the canvas is clean warm beige/cream gradient, providing an open, uncluttered zone for the dual celebration headlines. Brand red on beige achieves high contrast.
>
> **Decorative elements:** Subtle line-drawn floral/herb motifs at ~15% opacity on the beige text zone -- slightly more decorative than usual to match the celebratory mood. Fresh herbs and a lemon slice near the platters in the food zone.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "EID MUBARAK / HAPPY NOWRUZ" dual headline on beige (the community greeting -- respectful, warm, inclusive) --> SECOND: Celebratory family platter spread (the feast -- abundance, generosity, halal) --> THIRD: "Halal. Always." + CTA (the brand promise + action)
>
> **What NOT to include:** No borders, no frames, no specific religious symbols (no Haft-sin table, no crescent moon icons), no stickers, no clip art. Let the respectful messaging and the abundant food speak. Keep cultural celebrations food-focused and genuine.

**Date:** Every Friday (template for recurring use)

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- eye enters at the Falafel Corner logo at top-left, sweeps right across the "FALAFEL FRIDAY" headline in the top 15-25% zone, drops diagonally through the hero Falafel Wrap in the center, exits at the deal/CTA at the bottom. This matches the existing Falafel Friday post layout from the feed -- maintaining consistency with the brand's one established content series while upgrading the execution quality.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle hero shot of a Falafel Wrap, fully assembled and beautifully overflowing. The wrap is partially unwrapped/opened to show the filling: 3 golden-brown falafel balls nestled in shredded lettuce, diced tomato, sliced onion, with generous drizzles of white tzatziki and tahini sauce. The warm pita bread wraps around everything. The wrap is centered, fully contained, on a white ceramic plate. Beside the plate, a small bowl of extra tahini sauce and 2-3 loose golden falafel balls for visual abundance.
>
> **Environment:** Deep crimson background (#660711 to #910111) -- matching the existing Falafel Friday post color from the feed. This creates visual consistency: every Friday, followers see the deep crimson background and immediately know it's Falafel Friday. White ceramic plate on crimson background. Studio lighting, warm, bright.
>
> **Color palette:** Deep crimson (#660711 to #910111) as background. Falafel exterior is golden-brown (#d2a586 to #bb8249). Pita is warm golden. Lettuce is green. Tomato is red. Sauces are white/cream. The crimson background makes the golden falafel and white sauces pop dramatically. White (#FFFFFF) for text. Brand green (optional small accent) for the "FREE FRIES" callout.
>
> **Food styling:** The wrap should look STUFFED -- generous, overfilled, saucy. This is "Falafel Friday" energy: indulgent, special, treat-yourself. The loose falafel balls beside the wrap add visual abundance and show the quality of the falafel on its own.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Logo:** Falafel Corner flame/teardrop logo + text at top-left corner. White logo on crimson.

Positioned at ~75% canvas height, centered. Spans ~30% of canvas width (~310px), font height ~28px. This deal badge rotates -- some weeks it's "free fries," other weeks it's a different spotlight.

## Occasion 15: Meatless Monday (Recurring Weekly)
**Date:** Every Monday (template for recurring use)

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Asymmetric Hero -- the Falafel Wrap is positioned on the left side of the canvas (~55%), with a clean text zone on the right (~45%). This layout differentiates Meatless Monday posts from Falafel Friday posts (which use Z-Pattern on crimson) -- the different layout pattern means followers can visually distinguish the two recurring series at a glance. The asymmetric split also creates a modern, editorial feel that appeals to the health-conscious audience most likely to engage with Meatless Monday content.
>
> **Food photography:** 45-degree angle shot of a Falafel Wrap cut in half, positioned on the left side of the canvas on a white ceramic plate. The cross-section faces the camera, showing: crispy golden falafel balls, shredded green lettuce, diced red tomato, sliced white onion, white tzatziki drizzle, cream-colored tahini drizzle, all wrapped in golden pita. The green of the falafel interior and lettuce is prominent. A small side of extra falafel balls on the plate.
>
> **Environment:** Warm beige/cream gradient (#fbe2ba to #ffebc6) fills the background -- the lighter palette for Meatless Monday communicates health, freshness, and lightness. Clean, bright, natural-feeling studio lighting. White ceramic plate on beige gradient.

## Campaign Arc Notes

### Ramadan-to-Eid Bookend Arc (Feb 18 --> Mar 20)
1. **Ramadan Begins + Ash Wednesday (Feb 18):** Opening post -- establishes halal positioning, dual religious respect, Combo Platter as iftar hero
2. **Lenten Fridays (Feb 20, 27, Mar 6, 13, 20):** Falafel Wrap as meatless Friday option -- can overlap with Falafel Friday for double hooks
3. **Eid al-Fitr + Nowruz (Mar 20):** Closing post -- celebrates the end of Ramadan and Persian New Year, family platters, community warmth
4. **Visual consistency:** Both bookend posts use the Golden Ratio Split (inverted) layout with respectful text zones, creating a recognizable arc

### Counter-Programming Arc (3 posts)
- **National Tortilla Chip Day (Feb 24):** Pita chips beat tortilla chips
- **National Chili Day (Feb 26):** Combo Platter beats chili
- **National Potato Chip Day (Mar 14):** Shawarma Fries beat potato chips
- **Voice evolution:** These three posts inject the confident, personality-driven energy the brand currently lacks. "Respectfully... pita chips clear" is a tone shift from "Treat yourself to our Shawarma Fries at Falafel Corner!"

### March Madness 3-Post Arc
1. **Selection Sunday (Mar 15):** Hype/teaser -- "Your bracket's already wrong. Your food order doesn't have to be."
2. **St. Patrick's Day + First Four (Mar 17):** Bridge post -- green falafel visual hook + tournament opening
3. **First Round (Mar 19):** Payoff -- "Tournament fuel" maximum spread

### Menu Discovery Arc (3 posts)
- **Tortilla Chip Day (Feb 24):** Hummus + pita chips from catering menu
- **National Cold Cuts Day (Mar 3):** Gyro/shawarma quality credibility
- **National Snack Day (Mar 4):** Shawarma Fries as snack hero + full sides menu
- **Purpose:** Expand what followers associate with Falafel Corner beyond just falafel wraps

### Sacramento Local Arc (2+ posts)
- **Kings Game Night (Feb 28-Mar 1):** "Light the beam. Order the food." -- Sacramento-specific sports tie-in
- **Selection Sunday, St. Pat's, First Round:** Sacramento audience watches together
- **IWD (Mar 8):** Community post featuring real team members across 19+ Sacramento locations
- **Purpose:** Transform from a generic, could-be-anywhere brand to Sacramento's Mediterranean chain

### Falafel-as-Hero Visual Discovery
- **First Lenten Friday (Feb 20):** Falafel Wrap cross-section -- green interior visible
- **National Meatball Day (Mar 9):** Falafel as "OG plant-based meatball" -- green interior on crimson background
- **St. Patrick's Day (Mar 17):** "Actually green" -- falafel green interior as St. Patrick's Day visual hook
- **Purpose:** The green falafel interior becomes a signature visual motif unique to Falafel Corner's content

### Recurring Series Differentiation
- **Falafel Friday:** Deep crimson (#660711) background + Z-Pattern layout = instantly recognizable as Friday content
- **Meatless Monday:** Warm beige/cream (#fbe2ba) background + Asymmetric Hero layout = instantly recognizable as Monday content
- **Purpose:** Different background colors and layouts for each recurring series create visual rhythm in the feed

### Tone Evolution Strategy
The current brand voice is a 3/10 energy level with zero personality. This campaign introduces:
1. **Counter-programming confidence** (Occasions 3, 4, 10): "Respectfully... pita chips clear"
2. **Sacramento local pride** (Occasions 5, 11, 13A): "Light the beam. Order the food."
3. **Cultural awareness and respect** (Occasions 1, 8, 13B): "Eid Mubarak. Happy Nowruz. Halal. Always."
4. **Engagement hooks** (Occasions 7, 9): "Rank these" / "argue in the comments"
5. **Menu education** (Occasions 3, 6, 7): "Did you know we have chipotle hummus?"
6. **Value propositions** (Occasions 4, 14): "$17.50 -- that's two meals"

The shift should feel like Falafel Corner hired a real social media manager who actually eats there -- not like the brand personality changed overnight. Every post still says "Falafel Corner" and still uses the warm amber/crimson/beige palette. The upgrade is in the captions (personality, CTAs, line breaks, engagement hooks) and the prompt variety (four layout patterns instead of one).

### Key Performance Indicators to Watch
- **Caption CTAs added:** 0/post (current) --> 1/post (new). This is the single biggest conversion fix.
- **Hashtag count:** 3-6/post (current) --> 18-20/post (new). Should improve discoverability immediately.
- **Halal mentions:** 0 Instagram captions mention halal (current) --> 9 of 16 (new). The #1 customer-cited differentiator in DoorDash reviews, completely absent from social media.
- **Sacramento references:** 0 location-specific mentions (current) --> 7 of 16 (new). Local relevance for local discovery.
- **Engagement hooks (questions/challenges):** 0 (current) --> 6 of 16 (new). The feed currently asks the audience nothing.
- **Layout variety:** 1 pattern (current Z-pattern only) --> 4 patterns (Z-Pattern, Golden Ratio Split, Asymmetric Hero, Food-Framed Center). Visual variety prevents feed fatigue.

### The Biggest Opportunity
Falafel Corner has 1,806 weekly DoorDash orders but only 133 Instagram followers. The gap between market traction and social presence is the largest in the entire merchant dataset. Every occasion post includes a DoorDash ordering CTA because the audience is already delivery-first. The goal is not to change behavior -- it is to put a brand personality behind the orders they are already making. If even 1% of their weekly DoorDash customers follow the Instagram, that is 18 new followers per week -- doubling the current count in under 2 months.
