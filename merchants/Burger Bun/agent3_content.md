# Agent 3: Nano Banana Pro Content -- Burger Bun (@burgerbunla)

**Coverage Period:** February 18 -- March 20, 2026
**Total Occasions:** 12
**Brand Voice:** Playful. Confident. Obsessed.
**Caption Formula:** Short punchy hook --> ". . ." spacing --> "ORDER NOW! Link in bio ⏰️"
**Brand Colors:** Red (#dd2127 / #C41E2A), Black (#121212), White (#fff), Deep Burgundy (#470001)
**Playwright-Verified Environment Colors:** Primary wall: Vibrant orange (#E85D15) | Secondary wall: Kelly green (#5AA339) | Brand red (#DD2127) | Deep burgundy (#470001)
**Photography Style:** 45-degree hero shots, warm saturated colors, red plastic trays on neutral wood/beige counters, vibrant orange and kelly green walls as background colors
**Typography System:** Boogaloo (bold casual display, ALL CAPS, weight 400) for headlines | Satoshi (geometric sans-serif) for sub-headlines/CTAs | Forum (decorative serif) loaded but unused on website -- available as accent only
**Text Overlay Treatment:** Intentional design system -- each prompt specifies a named layout pattern (Z-Pattern, Golden Ratio Split, Asymmetric Hero, Food-Framed Center), a named readability technique (Bold text over food, Natural wall contrast, Surface text zone), and a 3-step eye flow path. Text placement is driven by design reasoning, not defaults.
**Serving Style:** Red plastic TRAYS with red-and-white CHECKERED deli paper lining -- NOT baskets, NOT parchment
**Environment Note:** Environment fields describe BACKGROUND COLORS and SURFACES only — they tell Nano Banana what colors appear behind the food and what the food sits on. Lighting descriptions (e.g., "warm, bright lighting") describe the QUALITY of light on the food (warm tones, bright highlights), NOT a physical setting to generate. Do not generate a restaurant interior, dining room, or store — just the wall color, surface, and food.

## Occasion 1: National Tortilla Chip Day -- Mexican Menu Surprise
**Date:** February 24, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- the eye enters at the headline in the top 20% where bold ALL CAPS white text sits against the orange wall, sweeps right, drops diagonally through the loaded Mexican Fries hero, and exits at the tacos on the lower right. Placing the headline at the TOP means the message ("NOT JUST BURGERS") registers before the food -- the viewer is primed to be surprised, then the Mexican menu items deliver the proof. This is a reveal composition.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle hero shot of Mexican Fries -- a generous pile of golden fresh-cut fries loaded with melted cheese, diced carne asada pieces, pico de gallo, jalapeno slices, and a drizzle of crema. The Mexican Fries are served in a red plastic tray lined with red-and-white checkered deli paper. Next to the tray, two carne asada tacos on a second red tray with checkered paper -- soft corn tortillas with grilled carne asada, cilantro, and diced white onion visible. The trays are positioned asymmetrically -- the hero item is slightly left-of-center and the secondary item extends partially beyond the right edge of the frame. The bottom edge of the nearest tray is cropped by the frame.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic trays sit on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting. A small cup of green salsa sits near the tacos.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) provides a warm, vibrant backdrop. Fries are vivid golden, cheese is bright yellow-orange, carne asada is rich brown with char marks, pico de gallo pops red and green, crema is bright white. Red trays match brand red (#dd2127). Warm overall tone.
>
> **Food styling:** The Mexican Fries are the hero -- piled high, loaded, messy in an appetizing way. Cheese strings visible. Tacos are neatly assembled but generous, showing the meat clearly. The spread looks like a discovery -- "you didn't know we had this."
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "NOT JUST BURGERS" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally in the top 20% of the canvas, positioned over the orange wall area above the food. Spans ~35% of image width (~360px width, ~55px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Natural wall contrast -- the orange wall (#E85D15) fills the top portion of the frame behind the text, providing a clean, uniform mid-tone backdrop for bold white ALL CAPS text. Orange is dark enough for white to pop but warm enough to feel on-brand. No overlay needed -- the wall IS the text background, exactly as the restaurant's own "TORTA THURSDAYS" promo posts use the orange wall as a graphic element.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "NOT JUST BURGERS" headline (the surprise/reveal hook) → SECOND: Mexican Fries loaded with toppings (the proof -- these are real, they're loaded, you've been missing out) → THIRD: Carne asada tacos + CTA (depth of menu + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no tortilla chip graphics.

## Occasion 2: Early Bird Special -- 15% Off Everything (10AM-11AM)
**Date:** Recurring (in-person only or phone pickup)

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- the eye enters at the top-left where bold white Boogaloo text announces "10AM-11AM" as the time window against the orange wall, sweeps right across the time callout, drops diagonally through the hero Boss Burger and fries spread in the center 50%, then exits at the "15% OFF EVERYTHING" sub-message and CTA in the bottom 15%. The time window at the top acts as the urgency hook -- the viewer reads the constraint first ("10AM-11AM"), then sees the reward (loaded tray of food), then gets the deal ("15% OFF"). This is a classic promo flyer structure: urgency → desire → action.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle hero shot of a freshly assembled Boss Burger -- double Angus beef patties with melted American and Swiss cheese oozing over the edges, crisp green lettuce, sliced red tomato, white onion, and pickles stacked between a golden toasted sesame bun. The burger sits in a red plastic tray lined with red-and-white checkered deli paper. Next to it, a generous pile of golden fresh-cut fries on the same tray, some standing upright. A tall milkshake in a clear plastic cup with dome lid and straw sits behind the tray, slightly out of focus -- showing the breadth of the deal (15% off EVERYTHING). The burger is positioned slightly left-of-center, with the fries extending beyond the right edge of the frame. The milkshake peeks into frame from the upper right. Dynamic, not centered -- the composition says "grab it all before 11AM."
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic tray sits on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) provides a warm, vibrant backdrop. Cheese is extra golden, lettuce pops vivid green, meat is rich deep brown, bun is warm golden. Red tray color should match brand red (#dd2127). Fries are vivid golden. Milkshake adds a creamy caramel/vanilla tone. Overall warmth skews toward golden morning tones.
>
> **Food styling:** Generous portions -- this is "15% off everything" energy, so the tray should look loaded and abundant. Cheese is visibly melting and draping over the patty edge. Fries are golden and crispy, piled high. The milkshake in the background shows this deal covers the full menu. The spread should feel like a steal -- a reward for showing up early.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "EARLY BIRD GETS THE BURGER" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally in the top 20% of the canvas, positioned over the orange wall area above the food. The orange wall (#E85D15) provides a clean, uniform mid-tone backdrop for bold white ALL CAPS text. Spans ~38% of image width (~390px width, ~50px cap height).
> - **Deal callout:** "15% OFF · 10AM-11AM" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff) text inside a brand red (#DD2127) semi-transparent rectangle (opacity 85%), sized to fit the text with 12px padding. Positioned directly below the headline in the top 25-30% zone. This is the key info -- the time window and discount percentage need to be immediately legible and distinct from the headline. Spans ~30% of image width (~310px width, ~35px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "In-person & phone pickup only · Call us!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size (~25px). Positioned in the bottom 12% of the canvas, over the dark tones of the tray edge and checkered paper shadows.
> - **Readability:** Natural wall contrast for headline (orange wall #E85D15 provides clean backdrop for white text). Brand color block for deal callout (red #DD2127 at 85% opacity creates a branded badge effect that separates the deal info from the headline). Bold text over food for the sub-headline (dark tray and paper shadows at the bottom of the frame).
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "EARLY BIRD GETS THE BURGER" headline over orange wall (the hook -- playful, confident, immediately communicates the deal concept) → SECOND: Boss Burger + fries + milkshake spread (the reward -- this is what 15% off gets you) → THIRD: "15% OFF · 10AM-11AM" deal badge + "In-person & phone pickup only" CTA (the specifics and action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no alarm clock icons, no sunrise graphics. Let the food and the deal speak.

## Occasion 3: March Madness First Round -- Tournament Survival Kit
**Date:** March 19, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Food-Framed Center -- four trays of food fill the entire frame in a tight, overlapping feast composition. The headline occupies the upper 35%, overlapping the wall area and the top of the spread. This is the biggest, most maximal shot in the campaign -- the payoff to the Selection Sunday teaser (Occasion 10). The text sits over the abundance, not beside it, because the message and the visual are the same: "TOURNAMENT SURVIVAL KIT" IS the four-tray feast you're looking at. Text and food reinforce each other.
>
> **Scene:** A slightly elevated 45-degree angle shot of a massive game-day spread -- this is the "tournament survival kit." Four red plastic trays with red-and-white checkered deli paper lining, arranged in a tight, overlapping spread to emphasize abundance. Tray 1: a Boss Burger, tall and loaded with cheese melt and all the fixings. Tray 2: 8 jumbo wings, sauced and golden-brown, with ranch. Tray 3: a mountain of golden fresh-cut fries. Tray 4: 4-5 golden chicken tenders with a small BBQ sauce cup. The trays overlap slightly -- this is a feast, not a neat arrangement. The spread extends beyond the frame edges on at least two sides -- trays are cut off at the left and right, creating an abundance effect. The composition is tight and overflowing, not neatly contained.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) on the left and kelly green accent wall (#5AA339) on the right, meeting at a corner -- both walls visible in the background behind the massive spread. Red plastic trays sit on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) and green wall (#5AA339) provide a vibrant, bold two-tone backdrop. Maximum golden-brown food tones. Wings are deep amber-glazed. Fries are vivid golden. Burger cheese is bright yellow. Tenders are golden-crispy. Red trays create pops of brand red (#dd2127). Warm, abundant, feast-mode colors.
>
> **Food styling:** MAXIMUM ABUNDANCE. This is the payoff shot after the Selection Sunday teaser. Four trays of food, all overflowing. Wings are glistening. Fries are piled impossibly high. The Boss Burger anchors the spread. Tenders add variety. This composition says: "16 games, 2 days, 1 order." Every tray is full to overflowing.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "TOURNAMENT SURVIVAL KIT" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned in the upper 35% of the canvas, overlapping the orange/green wall area and the top edge of the massive spread. The headline spans the full width of the feast -- "TOURNAMENT SURVIVAL KIT" over four overflowing trays creates a magazine-editorial composition where the text names what the viewer is already seeing. The two-tone wall (orange + green) provides solid contrast at the top of the letterforms, and the food tops add warm texture below. Spans ~42% of image width (~430px width, ~50px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Bold text over food -- same approach as Occasion 10 but scaled up. The upper 35% zone contains the two-tone wall (solid mid-tones) and the food spread tops (warm, textured). The large Boogaloo letterforms have enough visual weight to read over this mixed zone. At ~50px cap height on a 1350px canvas, the text is confident and editorial without being overwhelming. The abundance of the spread below the text reinforces the message -- the image proves the headline.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "TOURNAMENT SURVIVAL KIT" headline (the definitive statement -- naming the feast) → SECOND: Four overflowing trays of food (the proof -- burger, wings, fries, tenders, all overflowing) → THIRD: Individual item details (cheese melt, sauce glaze, crispy breading) + CTA (desire + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no bracket graphics, no basketball icons, no stickers, no team logos.

## Occasion 4: National Chili Day -- Double Decker Counter-Programming
**Date:** February 26, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Asymmetric Hero -- the Double Decker burger fills the frame from edge to edge vertically, positioned slightly right-of-center. The headline sits dead center, crossing the tall burger stack horizontally. This creates deliberate tension: the text interrupts the burger's towering height, forcing the viewer to see both simultaneously. "FORGET THE CHILI" written across the burger body makes the counter-programming argument visceral -- you're literally reading the message while staring at the alternative.
>
> **Scene:** An eye-level hero shot of the Double Decker burger -- two Angus beef patties stacked with Thousand Island sauce, pickles, crisp lettuce, sliced tomato, white onion, American cheese, Swiss cheese, and crispy bacon strips between a golden toasted sesame bun. The burger is massive, layers clearly visible from the eye-level angle showing the full cross-section of ingredients. Served in a red plastic tray lined with red-and-white checkered deli paper. A handful of golden fresh-cut fries scattered on the checkered paper beside the burger. The burger is positioned slightly right-of-center, with the top of the bun nearly touching the upper edge of the frame. The tray extends beyond the bottom-left of the frame. Close-up, dynamic framing.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic tray sits on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) provides a warm, vibrant backdrop. The Thousand Island sauce has a pinkish-orange tone. Cheese is vivid yellow. Bacon is deep reddish-brown and crispy. Lettuce is bright green. Bun is warm golden. Red tray matches brand red (#dd2127). Rich, indulgent color palette.
>
> **Food styling:** The Double Decker should look impossibly stacked -- you can barely fit your mouth around it. Cheese is draping and melted. Bacon strips peek out. Thousand Island drips slightly. This is maximum comfort food energy.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "FORGET THE CHILI" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned at the vertical center of the canvas, crossing directly over the burger stack body. The text overlays the dark patty layers, melted cheese, and bacon -- the rich browns and deep reds of the burger interior create a consistently dark backdrop where white display text reads with cinematic contrast. Spans ~32% of image width (~330px width, ~42px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Bold text over food -- the burger's cross-section at center frame is dominated by dark values (deep brown patties, reddish-brown bacon, dark Thousand Island sauce), creating a zone of low-key warmth that makes white text pop. The tension of text cutting across food is intentional -- it creates the "poster moment" that separates a designed flyer from a plain food photo.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Double Decker burger stack (the impossibly tall, eye-level hero -- the scroll-stopper) → SECOND: "FORGET THE CHILI" headline crossing the burger (the counter-programming hook, impossible to miss) → THIRD: Melting cheese + dripping Thousand Island + CTA (desire + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no chili bowl graphics, no spoon icons.

## Occasion 5: Game Day -- NBA Weekend Spread
**Date:** February 28 -- March 1, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Food-Framed Center -- the three trays of food form a natural frame around the center of the image, with the Boss Burger anchoring the middle and the wings and fries flanking it on either side. The headline sits at the center of this abundance, surrounded by food on all sides. The design intent is immersion: the viewer feels like they're sitting in front of the spread, and the text emerges from within the feast rather than floating above it. Food frames text, not the other way around.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree overhead-leaning angle shot of a full game-day spread on a counter surface. Center frame: a Boss Burger in a red plastic tray with red-and-white checkered deli paper -- Angus beef with American and Swiss cheese melt, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, golden sesame bun. To the left: a red plastic tray with red-and-white checkered paper holding 8 jumbo wings, golden-brown and sauced, with a small ranch cup. To the right: a red plastic tray with checkered paper piled with golden fresh-cut fries. The three trays form an appetizing triangle composition. The spread extends beyond the frame edges on at least two sides -- trays are cut off at the left and right, creating an abundance effect. The composition is tight and overflowing, not neatly contained.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) on the left and kelly green accent wall (#5AA339) on the right, meeting at a corner -- both walls visible in the background behind the spread. Red plastic trays sit on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) and green wall (#5AA339) provide a vibrant, bold two-tone backdrop. Wings are deep golden-brown with sauce glaze. Fries are vivid golden. Burger cheese is bright yellow. Bun is warm golden. Red trays pop against the counter. Rich, abundant color palette that says "feast."
>
> **Food styling:** This is an abundance shot. Three separate trays loaded with food -- the message is "this is your game day order." Wings are sauced and glistening. Fries are piled high. The Boss Burger anchors the center. Everything looks fresh and just-served.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "GAME DAY SORTED" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned at the vertical center of the canvas, anchored over the center of the spread between the trays. The text sits within the food composition -- wings to the left, fries to the right, burger below -- so the food frames the headline on all sides. The dark tones of the sauced wings, burger patty, and shadowed areas between trays provide a variegated but consistently warm-dark backdrop for white text. Spans ~34% of image width (~350px width, ~44px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Bold text over food -- the text is anchored at the center of the abundance, where the overlapping trays, dark sauce glaze on wings, and burger shadow create a dense, warm tonal zone. White Boogaloo text reads over this area because the food mass provides consistent mid-to-dark values. The food-framed composition means the text feels embedded in the feast, not pasted on top.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: The full spread (three loaded trays -- immediate abundance, the scroll-stopper) → SECOND: "GAME DAY SORTED" headline at center (the hook, surrounded by food) → THIRD: Individual items (Boss Burger, wings, fries) + CTA (what to order + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no basketball graphics, no team logos, no stickers.

## Occasion 6: National Cold Cuts Day -- Award-Winning Pastrami
**Date:** March 3, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- the eye enters at the top-left where the orange wall glows warm, sweeps right across the pastrami cross-section (the hero moment), drops diagonally to the headline in the bottom 18%, then exits through the CTA. The pastrami's dramatic pink-and-bark cross-section dominates the upper frame, and the text anchors the bottom where the tray and meat edges create a dark landing zone for the award claim.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle hero shot of the award-winning pastrami sandwich. The sandwich is cut in half and stacked slightly, revealing the cross-section: thin-sliced, piled-high pastrami (deep reddish-pink with a dark peppery bark edge), melted Swiss cheese, and mustard between fresh sliced bread. The pastrami is STACKED -- this is not a thin sandwich; the meat is piled dramatically high, at least 2-3 inches of sliced pastrami. Served in a red plastic tray lined with red-and-white checkered deli paper. A few golden fries scattered on the checkered paper beside the sandwich. A small cup of mustard on the tray. The sandwich is positioned slightly left-of-center, with the fries/side extending beyond the right edge of the frame. Not a perfectly centered product shot -- the framing feels dynamic and caught-in-the-moment.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic tray sits on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) provides a warm, vibrant backdrop. Pastrami is deep pinkish-red with dark charred edges. Swiss cheese is pale yellow and melted. Bread is warm golden. Mustard is vivid yellow. Red tray matches brand red (#dd2127). The warm tones emphasize the smoky, savory quality.
>
> **Food styling:** The pastrami pile is the star -- impossibly tall, sliced thin, steaming-hot energy. The cut cross-section shows the layers. Cheese is melted and clinging to the meat. This should look award-winning.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "BEST PASTRAMI IN TOWN" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned in the bottom 18% of the canvas, overlapping the tray/pastrami area. The headline sits over the dark pastrami cross-section where the peppery bark edge and deep reddish-pink meat provide rich, dark contrast for white text. The red tray (#9E1E12) and checkered paper shadows reinforce the dark zone. Spans ~40% of image width (~410px width, ~48px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Bold text over food -- the bottom of the frame is dominated by the pastrami's dark bark crust, the deep red meat edge, and the red plastic tray, creating a consistently dark tonal band. White Boogaloo text achieves high contrast naturally over this meat-and-tray zone. The smoky, dark quality of pastrami makes it one of the best foods for text overlay -- no gradient or vignette needed.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Pastrami cross-section (the impossibly stacked pink-and-bark layers -- the scroll-stopper) → SECOND: Melted Swiss cheese + fries (context: this is a full meal, not just deli meat) → THIRD: "BEST PASTRAMI IN TOWN" headline + CTA (the award claim + action)

> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- the eye enters at the headline in the top 20% where bold ALL CAPS white text sits against the green wall, sweeps right, drops diagonally through the triangular arrangement of snack trays, and exits at the marinara sauce cup in the front tray. Headline at top works here because it's a challenge ("PICK YOUR FIGHTER") that demands the viewer look down at the three contenders below. The green wall at top provides a clean canvas for the promo-style typography.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle shot of three red plastic trays with red-and-white checkered deli paper lining, arranged in a triangular layout. Tray 1 (center-front): golden crispy mozzarella sticks, 5-6 pieces, with a small cup of marinara sauce. Tray 2 (left-rear): golden jalapeno poppers, crispy breading with a peek of green jalapeno and melted cream cheese visible where one is bitten/broken open. Tray 3 (right-rear): a pile of golden onion rings, thick-battered, perfectly round. All items are freshly fried and glistening. The snack trays are positioned slightly off-center, with the front tray cropped by the bottom edge of the frame. The rear trays extend toward the upper corners. Dynamic, not centered.
>
> **Environment:** Kelly green accent wall (#5AA339) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic trays sit on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Green wall (#5AA339) provides a fresh, bold backdrop. All fried items are vivid golden-brown. Marinara is bright red. Cream cheese inside poppers is white. Red trays match brand red (#dd2127). The golden tones dominate, making everything look hot and crispy.
>
> **Food styling:** Each item is freshly fried -- golden, crispy, with visible texture on the breading. The mozzarella sticks should have a slight cheese pull visible on one. The poppers show the cream cheese filling. Onion rings are thick and perfectly circular. This is a snack attack lineup.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "PICK YOUR FIGHTER" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally in the top 20% of the canvas, positioned over the green wall area above the food trays. Spans ~36% of image width (~370px width, ~55px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Natural wall contrast -- the kelly green wall (#5AA339) fills the top portion of the frame behind the text, providing a uniform mid-tone backdrop for bold white ALL CAPS text. Green is a complementary contrast to white and dark enough for high legibility. The wall acts as a built-in colored text field -- this mirrors Burger Bun's own "TORTA THURSDAYS" approach of using their interior walls as graphic design elements.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "PICK YOUR FIGHTER" headline (the challenge/hook -- immediately engaging) → SECOND: Three snack trays in triangle formation (the contenders -- mozz sticks, poppers, onion rings) → THIRD: Marinara cup + broken popper + CTA (textural detail + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no numbered labels, no ranking graphics.

## Occasion 8: National Ranch Dressing Day -- Dip Everything
**Date:** March 10, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Golden Ratio Split -- the ranch cup sits at the golden ratio intersection point (~38% from left, ~62% from top), and the dipping fry creates a diagonal action line pointing toward it. The headline sits at the vertical center, overlapping the golden-brown mass of fries, onion rings, and tenders. This layout turns the dip-in-action moment into the focal point and frames the text within the food rather than above or below it -- the viewer reads "DIP EVERYTHING" while surrounded by dippable items.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle shot centered on a red plastic tray with red-and-white checkered deli paper lining. On the tray: a generous pile of golden fresh-cut fries on one side, 4-5 golden crispy onion rings on the other side, and 3-4 golden chicken tenders arranged in between. In the center of the tray, a small cup of creamy white ranch dressing. One fry is mid-dip in the ranch, frozen in motion (partially submerged), creating a dynamic action shot. A few drops of ranch on the checkered paper. The trays are positioned asymmetrically -- the hero item is slightly left-of-center and the secondary item extends partially beyond the right edge of the frame. The bottom edge of the nearest tray is cropped by the frame.
>
> **Environment:** Kelly green accent wall (#5AA339) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic tray sits on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Green wall (#5AA339) provides a fresh, bold backdrop. Fries, onion rings, and tenders are all vivid golden-brown. Ranch is creamy white. Red tray matches brand red (#dd2127). Checkered paper adds red-and-white pattern. Warm golden tones dominate.
>
> **Food styling:** The dip-in-action moment is the hero -- a fry entering the ranch. Everything is crispy and freshly fried. The ranch cup is full and creamy. The arrangement feels casual and inviting, like someone's about to dig in. This is a "we don't judge your dipping habits" energy.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "DIP EVERYTHING" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned at the vertical center of the canvas, overlapping the golden-brown fried food mass. The Boogaloo headline sits over the dense pile of fries, onion rings, and tenders -- the deep golden-brown tones of battered/fried food provide a warm, consistent backdrop for white display text. Spans ~30% of image width (~310px width, ~40px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Bold text over food -- the center of the frame is packed with golden-brown fried items that create a dense, warm tonal mass. Fried food is ideal for text overlay because the breading creates a consistent, non-reflective mid-tone surface. White Boogaloo text cuts cleanly across this golden field. The ranch cup (bright white) and green wall (top of frame) bookend the composition without interfering with the text zone.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Fry mid-dip in ranch (the action moment -- frozen motion, the scroll-stopper) → SECOND: "DIP EVERYTHING" headline over the golden food spread (the permission/hook) → THIRD: Full lineup of dippables (fries, rings, tenders) + CTA (what to order + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no ranch bottle graphics.

## Occasion 9: National Potato Chip Day -- Fries Over Chips
**Date:** March 14, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- the eye enters at the headline in the top 20% where bold ALL CAPS white text sits against the orange wall, sweeps right, drops diagonally through the loaded Mexican Fries (the star), and exits at the classic fries tray on the lower left. Headline at top works for the same reason as Occasion 1 -- the message ("FRIES OVER CHIPS") is a challenge that demands the viewer look down at the proof. The orange wall provides the promo-style backdrop for the combative typography.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle hero shot of two red plastic trays with red-and-white checkered deli paper lining, side by side. Tray 1 (left): a mountain of golden, crispy fresh-cut fries -- thick-cut, skin-on, piled high and tumbling slightly. Tray 2 (right): loaded Mexican Fries -- same golden fries but buried under melted orange cheese, diced carne asada, pico de gallo (red tomato, green cilantro, white onion), jalapeno slices, and a zigzag of white crema. The Mexican Fries are the visual centerpiece, slightly larger in the frame. The trays are positioned asymmetrically -- the hero item is slightly left-of-center and the secondary item extends partially beyond the right edge of the frame. The bottom edge of the nearest tray is cropped by the frame.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic trays sit on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) provides a warm, vibrant backdrop. Fries are vivid golden. Cheese on Mexican Fries is bright orange-yellow. Carne asada is rich brown. Pico pops red and green. Crema is bright white. Red trays match brand red (#dd2127). This image is a color explosion -- golden, red, green, white, orange.
>
> **Food styling:** The fries are the hero in both forms -- classic and loaded. The classic fries are perfectly golden and crispy with visible salt crystals. The Mexican Fries are a beautiful mess of toppings. Both piles are GENEROUS -- overflowing the trays slightly. This is a "chips could never" energy.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "FRIES OVER CHIPS" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally in the top 20% of the canvas, positioned over the orange wall area above the food trays. Spans ~38% of image width (~390px width, ~58px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Natural wall contrast -- the vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) fills the top portion of the frame behind the text, providing a clean, uniform mid-tone backdrop for bold white ALL CAPS text. Identical approach to Occasions 1 and 7 -- the restaurant's interior walls function as built-in graphic design elements for promo-style posts. Orange provides warm contrast that makes the white text feel bold and energetic.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "FRIES OVER CHIPS" headline (the challenge/trash-talk hook) → SECOND: Mexican Fries loaded with cheese, carne asada, pico, crema (the proof -- chips can't do THIS) → THIRD: Classic fries mountain + CTA (the full lineup + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no potato chip bag graphics, no comparison arrows.

## Occasion 10: Selection Sunday -- March Madness Hype
**Date:** March 15, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Food-Framed Center -- the three trays form a feast spread that fills the frame, and the headline occupies the upper 35% where it overlaps both the wall area and the top of the food. This is a magazine-editorial composition: large, confident display text over a busy abundance shot. The text size and position communicate authority -- "SELECTION SUNDAY SORTED" reads as a definitive statement, and the overflowing food below proves it. The viewer sees the headline and the feast as one unified declaration.
>
> **Scene:** A slightly elevated 45-degree angle shot of a full game-day spread arranged on a counter, shot to look like a watch-party setup. Three red plastic trays with red-and-white checkered deli paper lining, arranged in a loose spread. Tray 1 (center): a Boss Burger -- Angus beef with melted American and Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, golden sesame bun, looking tall and fresh. Tray 2 (left): 8 jumbo wings, golden-brown with sauce glaze, with a small ranch cup. Tray 3 (right): a generous pile of golden fresh-cut fries. The trays are slightly overlapping, creating a grouped "feast" composition rather than separated individual items. The spread extends beyond the frame edges on at least two sides -- trays are cut off at the left and right, creating an abundance effect. The composition is tight and overflowing, not neatly contained.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) on the left and kelly green accent wall (#5AA339) on the right, meeting at a corner -- both walls visible in the background behind the spread. Red plastic trays sit on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) and green wall (#5AA339) provide a vibrant, bold two-tone backdrop. Wings are deep golden-brown and glazed. Burger cheese is bright yellow, lettuce is vivid green. Fries are golden. Red trays pop against the counter. Bun is warm golden-brown. Overall warm, rich, feast-mode palette.
>
> **Food styling:** Maximum abundance. This is a "feed the whole room" spread. Wings are sauced and glistening. The Boss Burger sits tall and proud in the center. Fries are piled high. Every tray is full. The composition says: "This is everything you need for Selection Sunday."
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "SELECTION SUNDAY SORTED" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned in the upper 35% of the canvas, overlapping the orange/green wall area and the top edge of the food spread. The large Boogaloo text sits where the two-tone wall meets the food -- partly over the wall colors, partly over the top of the wings and burger bun. This creates a magazine-editorial feel: oversized display text confidently placed over a busy scene, readable because the wall provides contrast at the top of the letterforms while the food provides warmth below. Spans ~40% of image width (~410px width, ~50px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Bold text over food -- the upper 35% zone is a mix of wall color and food tops. The orange (#E85D15) and green (#5AA339) walls provide solid mid-tone contrast in the background, while the top edges of the food (bun tops, wing surfaces) add warm detail. Large Boogaloo letterforms at this scale have enough visual weight to read over the varied backdrop, creating the editorial-poster look that defines magazine food photography.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "SELECTION SUNDAY SORTED" headline (the definitive statement -- large, confident, impossible to miss) → SECOND: The full feast spread below (three loaded trays -- the proof that it's sorted) → THIRD: Individual items (Boss Burger, wings, fries) + CTA (what to order + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no basketball graphics, no bracket imagery, no team logos.

## Occasion 11: St. Patrick's Day + March Madness First Four
**Date:** March 17, 2026

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Z-Pattern -- the eye enters at the headline in the upper 35% where white Boogaloo text sits over the green wall, sweeps right across the Wagyu burger's golden bun and cheese cascade, drops diagonally through the patty cross-section, and exits at the fries and tray at the bottom. The green wall (#5AA339) is the star of the environment here because it naturally ties to St. Patrick's Day without any gimmicky graphics -- the restaurant's own interior does the thematic work. The headline in the upper zone means the viewer reads "FEELING LUCKY?" while seeing green everywhere.
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle hero shot of the Kobe Wagyu Burger as the premium star. The burger is massive and beautiful: a thick Wagyu patty with melted American and Swiss cheese cascading down the sides, Thousand Island sauce, crisp lettuce, sliced pickles, red tomato, and white onion between a perfectly golden, toasted sesame bun. The patty has a visible sear crust and juice glistening. Served in a red plastic tray with red-and-white checkered deli paper lining. A few golden fries are visible on the checkered paper beside the burger. The framing is tight -- the Wagyu burger is the undeniable hero filling most of the frame. The burger is positioned slightly left-of-center, with the fries/side extending beyond the right edge of the frame. Not a perfectly centered product shot -- the framing feels dynamic and caught-in-the-moment.
>
> **Environment:** Kelly green accent wall (#5AA339) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic tray sits on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Green wall (#5AA339) provides a fresh, bold backdrop that naturally echoes St. Patrick's Day green. The Wagyu patty has a deep, rich brown with a caramelized crust. Cheese is vivid golden-yellow. Lettuce pops bright green. Tomato is vivid red. Bun is warm golden with visible sesame seeds. Thousand Island has a pinkish-orange tone. Red tray matches brand red (#dd2127). Premium, rich, aspirational color palette.
>
> **Food styling:** This burger should look like the most premium thing on the menu -- because it is. The Wagyu patty is thick and juicy with visible sear. Cheese drapes elegantly. The stack is tall but controlled -- this isn't messy, it's aspirational. The green lettuce and pickles naturally tie into the St. Patrick's Day green without being gimmicky.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "FEELING LUCKY?" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned in the upper 35% of the canvas, over the green wall. The kelly green wall (#5AA339) provides a solid, uniform backdrop for the white Boogaloo text -- and the green-on-white combination doubles as St. Patrick's Day theming without any shamrock graphics needed. The restaurant's own interior color does the holiday work. Spans ~30% of image width (~310px width, ~40px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Natural wall contrast -- the kelly green wall (#5AA339) fills the upper portion of the frame behind the text, providing a clean, uniform mid-tone backdrop for white Boogaloo text. This is the same natural-contrast approach as Occasions 1, 7, and 9, but here the green wall serves double duty: it's both a readability solution AND the St. Patrick's Day color story. Elegant and effortless.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: "FEELING LUCKY?" headline over green wall (the hook + holiday tie-in -- immediately evocative) → SECOND: Kobe Wagyu Burger hero (the thick patty, cascading cheese, sear crust -- the premium scroll-stopper) → THIRD: Fries on checkered paper + CTA (the meal completion + action)

## Occasion 12: Carne Asada Torta Spotlight -- Menu Hero
**Date:** Any Thursday (Torta Thursdays) or standalone menu spotlight

### A. Nano Banana Pro Image Generation Prompt

> **Format:** 1030 x 1350 px Instagram poster, portrait orientation.
>
> **Layout:** Asymmetric Hero -- the Carne Asada Torta fills the center frame, cut in half to reveal the loaded cross-section. The headline sits in the bottom 18%, anchoring the menu spotlight below the hero food. This is a pure product shot -- no secondary items competing for attention, no holiday gimmick. The torta's cross-section is the entire composition, and the tight framing says "this speaks for itself."
>
> **Scene:** A 45-degree angle hero shot of a Carne Asada Torta cut in half, revealing the cross-section. The torta is built on a crispy, golden bolillo roll with visible grill marks on the exterior. Inside: generous slices of grilled carne asada with char marks and juicy edges, melted white cheese (queso Oaxaca style) stretching between the two halves in visible cheese strings, sliced avocado (bright green), pickled jalapeño slices, refried beans, and fresh cilantro leaves. The two halves are positioned slightly offset -- one half angled toward the camera showing the full cross-section, the other half behind it at a slight angle. Served in a red plastic tray lined with red-and-white checkered deli paper. A few golden fresh-cut fries scattered on the checkered paper beside the torta. The tray is positioned slightly left-of-center, with the right edge extending partially beyond the frame. The bottom edge of the tray is cropped by the frame. Close-up, tight framing -- the torta fills the frame.
>
> **Environment:** Vibrant orange wall (#E85D15) visible in the background behind the food. Red plastic tray sits on a neutral wood/beige counter (#8B6914). Warm, bright lighting.
>
> **Color palette:** Bright, warm, high-saturation. Orange wall (#E85D15) provides a warm, vibrant backdrop. The bolillo roll is golden-brown with visible char marks from the grill. Carne asada is rich brown with grill marks and juicy caramelized edges. Avocado is bright, fresh green. Cheese is white and stretchy. Jalapeños are bright green. Refried beans are rich warm brown. Red tray matches brand red (#dd2127). Warm, appetizing tones throughout -- this image should feel like biting into summer.
>
> **Food styling:** The cross-section is the hero -- the torta is cut to show maximum filling. Cheese strings pulling between the two halves (the money shot). Carne asada is piled generously with visible char and a slightly pink center. Avocado slices are fresh and vivid green. The bolillo has a crispy golden exterior with a soft white interior visible at the cut edge. This should look like the best Mexican sandwich you've ever seen -- no gimmick needed, the food does all the talking.
>
> **Text design:**
> - **Headline:** "CARNE ASADA TORTA" -- Boogaloo (bold casual display), weight 400, ALL CAPS. White (#fff). Centered horizontally, positioned in the bottom 18% of the canvas, overlapping the tray/food area at the bottom of the frame. The dark tones of the red tray (#9E1E12), checkered paper shadows, and the charred carne asada edges provide a warm, dark zone where white Boogaloo text reads with high contrast. Spans ~38% of image width (~390px width, ~48px cap height).
> - **Sub-headline:** "Order now · Link in bio!" -- Satoshi (geometric sans-serif), sentence case, regular weight. White (#fff). Half the headline size. Directly below headline with generous spacing.
> - **Readability:** Bold text over food -- the bottom of the frame contains the tray edge, checkered paper, and the lower portion of the torta where charred carne asada and the dark bolillo crust provide consistently warm-dark values. White Boogaloo text reads cleanly over this zone without any overlay or gradient needed.
>
> **Eye flow:** FIRST: Torta cross-section with cheese pull (carne asada layers, avocado, stretchy white cheese -- the scroll-stopper) → SECOND: Bolillo roll texture and char marks (craft and quality cues -- this is grilled, not microwaved) → THIRD: "CARNE ASADA TORTA" headline + CTA (what it is + action)
>
> **Exclusions:** No borders, no frames, no stickers, no Mexican flag graphics, no "Torta Thursday" day-specific branding (keep it evergreen).
