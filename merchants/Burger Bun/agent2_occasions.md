## Priority Set (Occasions 1-3)

### 1. National Tortilla Chip Day -- Mexican Menu Surprise
**Date:** Tuesday, February 24, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Burger Bun's Mexican menu is a sleeper hit -- carne asada tacos, burritos, tortas, quesadillas, and Mexican Fries are all on the menu. National Tortilla Chip Day is the perfect excuse to spotlight the Mexican side of the menu that followers may not know about. Tortilla chips pair naturally with nachos, quesadillas, and the Mexican Fries (a fan favorite on review sites).
**Suggested campaign angle:** "You know us for burgers. But have you tried the Mexican Fries?" -- Use this food day to surprise followers with menu depth. Hero the Mexican Fries or carne asada tacos. The hook should play on the element of surprise: Burger Bun is more than burgers. CTA: order Mexican Fries or tacos via link in bio.

### 2. Early Bird Special -- 15% Off Everything
**Date:** Recurring (can be posted anytime; recommended launch week: Feb 25 or any Week 2-5 slot)
**Why it's relevant:** The merchant is running a daily 10AM-11AM Early Bird Special: **15% off everything, in-person only or phone pickup.** This is a foot-traffic and phone-order driver for the quietest hour of the day. The 18-35 audience includes early lunch breakers, remote workers, and deal-seekers. Burger Bun opens early and most competitors don't push morning/pre-lunch promos -- this is a window to own. The "in-person or phone pickup only" angle also creates exclusivity (not available on delivery apps), which drives urgency and FOMO.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "The 10AM move that saves you 15%." -- Position the Early Bird Special as the insider hack for regulars. Hero a loaded tray (Boss Burger + fries, or a breakfast-adjacent item) with the time and discount front and center. Lean into the brand's confident "if you know, you know" energy. The exclusivity of in-person/phone-only makes it feel like a VIP deal. CTA: call to order or come in between 10-11AM.

### 3. March Madness First Round -- Tournament Survival Kit
**Date:** Thursday, March 19, 2026 (NCAA First Round Day 1)
**Why it's relevant:** This is the merchant's #1 priority occasion. March Madness First Round is peak game-day food ordering -- 16 games over two days, afternoon tip-offs, everyone watching at home or at work. The merchant specifically requested March Madness content. Burgers + wings + fries + tenders for every game. This is the payoff post after the Selection Sunday teaser (Occasion 10).
**Suggested campaign angle:** "16 games. 1 order. Boss Burger, Jumbo Wings, Fries, and Tenders -- your tournament survival kit." -- Full game-day energy. Hero a massive spread of food positioned as the "watch party essentials." The biggest, most maximal shot in the campaign. CTA: order your March Madness spread via DoorDash, link in bio.

---

## Week 2: February 25 -- March 3, 2026

### 4. National Chili Day -- Double Decker Counter-Programming
**Date:** Thursday, February 26, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Chili is comfort food that aligns with Burger Bun's American fast-casual positioning. Even if Burger Bun doesn't serve chili specifically, the "loaded comfort food" vibe connects directly to their loaded burgers, chili cheese fries energy, and the indulgent winter-comfort-food mood. Late February in LA still has cool evenings -- perfect for a "warm up with something loaded" angle.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Forget the chili. Load up a Double Decker instead." -- Another confident counter-programming play. Position the Double Decker (double Angus beef, Thousand Island, bacon, American & Swiss cheese) as the ultimate comfort food that beats a bowl of chili. Lean into the brand's playful, slightly competitive tone. CTA: ORDER NOW! Link in bio.

---

### 5. Lakers Home Game Weekend / Game Day Energy
**Date:** Weekend of February 28 -- March 1, 2026 (Lakers have a home stretch this period; NBA regular season in full swing)
**Why it's relevant:** The merchant specifically flagged "game day" as a priority occasion. The Lakers are in the thick of their 2025-26 regular season, and LA sports energy is always high. Burger Bun is in Glendale -- 15 minutes from downtown LA -- and game-day food ordering spikes on delivery platforms. Burgers + wings + fries = the classic game-day spread.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Game day lineup: Boss Burger. Jumbo Wings. Fries. That's it. That's the play." -- Position Burger Bun as the game-day order. Hero a spread of burgers, wings, and fries. Tap into the Lakers/Clippers/college basketball energy without needing to name a specific team. CTA: order the game-day spread via DoorDash, link in bio.

---

### 6. National Cold Cuts Day (Pastrami Spotlight)
**Date:** Tuesday, March 3, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** This is a layup for Burger Bun's award-winning pastrami. "Best Pastrami in Town" in 2020, 2022, and 2025 -- the awards speak for themselves. National Cold Cuts Day gives a platform to hero one of the brand's most decorated menu items outside of burgers. Pastrami sandwiches are a strong secondary revenue driver and a point of pride.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Best Pastrami in Town. 2020. 2022. 2025. We don't just do burgers." -- Lead with the awards and let the accolades do the talking. Show the pastrami stacked high. This is a credibility post that also expands what followers associate with Burger Bun. CTA: ORDER NOW! Link in bio.

---

## Week 3: March 4--10, 2026

### 7. National Snack Day -- Sides Lineup
**Date:** Wednesday, March 4, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** The merchant flagged "happy hour" and "early bird specials" as priority hooks. National Snack Day is the perfect vehicle to push afternoon/early evening snack orders -- mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, onion rings, zucchini sticks, and fries. These are high-margin side items that drive add-on orders on DoorDash.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "3pm snack attack: Mozzarella Sticks, Jalapeno Poppers, Onion Rings -- pick your fighter." -- Tap into the mid-afternoon cravings moment. Position Burger Bun's sides as the snack lineup. Use a playful "pick your fighter" or "ranking" format to drive comments and engagement. CTA: order your snack fix via link in bio.

---

### 8. National Ranch Dressing Day -- Dip Everything
**Date:** Tuesday, March 10, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Ranch is America's favorite dipping sauce, and it pairs perfectly with Burger Bun's fries, onion rings, chicken tenders, and wings. This is a sides/add-ons play that highlights the homemade sauces Burger Bun takes pride in. The "dip everything in ranch" culture is strong with the 18-35 demographic.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Fries + ranch. Wings + ranch. Onion rings + ranch. We don't judge." -- Celebrate the universal ranch obsession by showing Burger Bun's sides getting dunked. This is engagement-bait done right: ask followers "what do you dip in ranch?" to drive comments. CTA: order fries and add ranch via link in bio.

---

## Week 4: March 11--17, 2026

### 9. National Potato Chip Day -- Fries Over Chips
**Date:** Saturday, March 14, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** Potato chips are fine, but Burger Bun's fresh-cut fries and Mexican Fries are better. This is another confident counter-programming opportunity that showcases the brand's playful personality. Fries are a massive add-on driver for delivery orders, and this post keeps the "sides" conversation going in the lead-up to March Madness game-day ordering.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Chips are cool. Our fries are an obsession." -- Callback to the brand tagline "It's an obsession." Hero the fries (regular or Mexican Fries) in all their golden, crispy glory. Short, punchy, on-brand. CTA: ORDER NOW! Link in bio.

---

### 10. March Madness Bracket Hype / Selection Sunday
**Date:** Sunday, March 15, 2026 (Selection Sunday -- brackets revealed at 6pm ET / 3pm PT)
**Why it's relevant:** This is the merchant's #1 priority occasion. March Madness is the biggest sports event of March, and Selection Sunday kicks off weeks of game-day food ordering. Bracket reveals are a massive social media moment -- everyone is watching, reacting, and ordering food. Burger Bun can own the "bracket reveal watch party food" moment for their Glendale audience.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Your bracket's busted by Thursday. Your burger order shouldn't be. Boss Burger + Wings + Fries = the only sure thing in March." -- Tie into Selection Sunday energy. Position Burger Bun as the official food of bracket watching. This is the teaser/hype post before the tournament starts. CTA: order your Selection Sunday spread via DoorDash, link in bio.

---

### 11. St. Patrick's Day
**Date:** Tuesday, March 17, 2026
**Why it's relevant:** St. Patrick's Day is a top-5 social media moment in March. While Burger Bun isn't Irish-themed, the green color hook connects to their loaded burgers (lettuce, pickles, jalapenos, avocado) and the "luck" angle creates a fun engagement play. The real value is riding the massive hashtag volume (#StPatricksDay) to reach new followers. Also, this is the same day as the March Madness First Four, doubling the game-day energy.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Feeling lucky? Order a Kobe Wagyu Burger. That's the real pot of gold." -- Use the St. Patrick's Day "luck" theme with a premium menu callout. The Kobe Wagyu Burger ($17.80) is the aspirational order -- position it as a treat-yourself moment. Bonus: tie in March Madness First Four ("Lucky enough to make the tournament? Lucky enough to eat Wagyu."). CTA: ORDER NOW! Link in bio.

## Menu Spotlight

### 12. Carne Asada Torta Spotlight
**Date:** Any Thursday (Torta Thursdays) or standalone menu spotlight
**Why it's relevant:** Burger Bun already runs "Torta Thursdays" as a recurring promo -- it's one of their existing content formats with its own graphic template (white text on solid orange background). The Carne Asada Torta is a featured menu item with its own CTA on recent posts ("ORDER OUR CARNE ASADA TORTA NOW!"). Tortas represent the Mexican side of the menu that most followers don't know about, and spotlighting one as a standalone hero item -- no food holiday, no gimmick -- lets the food speak for itself. This is a pure menu discovery play.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "This is the Carne Asada Torta. No gimmick. No holiday. Just a really good torta." -- A stripped-back, confidence-forward menu spotlight. Hero the torta cross-section showing the carne asada, avocado, melted cheese, and jalapeños inside the crispy bolillo roll. The tone is "we don't need an excuse to show you this." CTA: ORDER NOW! Link in bio.
