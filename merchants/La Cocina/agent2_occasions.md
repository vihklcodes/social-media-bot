## Week 1: Feb 23 – Mar 1

### Occasion 1: Mofongo Monday (Feb 23)
**Date:** Monday, February 23
**Why it's relevant:** Mofongo is La Cocina's #1 hero product — pinned on Instagram, mentioned in every food review, and specifically requested by the Mx for a highlight. Launching a recurring "Mofongo Monday" series creates a branded weekly ritual their audience can anticipate. Dominican diners already associate Mondays with hearty starts to the week.
**Suggested campaign angle:** Introduce "Mofongo Monday" as a recurring series. Showcase 3-4 mofongo varieties (con churrasco, con camarones, con pollo, trifongo) in a single hero image. CTA: "Which mofongo are you starting the week with? 🔥 Call 856-324-0269 or order on DoorDash." Pre-occasion teaser: Story poll Sunday night — "Tomorrow is Mofongo Monday — what's your order?"

### Occasion 2: Lunch Special Promo (Feb 25, Wednesday)
**Date:** Wednesday, February 25
**Why it's relevant:** Mx specifically requested promoting their lunch special (11am-2pm, pork or chicken with rice + free soda, starting at $9.99). Mid-week is when lunch traffic dips — this post drives weekday volume. The $9.99 price point is a strong value hook for the working community in Pennsauken.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Your $9.99 lunch break just got an upgrade." Show the actual lunch plate (generous portion) with the price prominently featured. Emphasize the FREE soda. Time-sensitive CTA: "11am-2pm only. Don't sleep on it. 📍5010 Westfield Ave." Could pair with a Story countdown sticker to build urgency.

### Occasion 3: Dominican Independence Day 🇩🇴 (Feb 27, Friday)
**Date:** Friday, February 27
**Why it's relevant:** This is THE cultural moment for La Cocina's core audience. Dominican Independence Day celebrates the founding of the Dominican Republic — and La Cocina sits in the heart of Pennsauken's Dominican community. This post should be the most emotionally resonant content of the month. Also falls on a Lenten Friday, creating a natural dual angle with their camarones/seafood dishes.
**Suggested campaign angle:** Hero post — "Celebrando nuestra independencia con el sabor de casa 🇩🇴" Full spread of Dominican staples: mofongo, pernil, pica pollo, rice and beans, tostones. Dual CTA: celebrate with family at La Cocina + order catering for Dominican Independence Day parties. Secondary angle: "Lenten Friday? Our camarones al mofongo has you covered 🔥🇩🇴." Pre-occasion teaser on Feb 25-26 with countdown.

---

## Week 2: Mar 2 – 8

### Occasion 1: Mofongo Monday — Camarones Edition (Mar 2)
**Date:** Monday, March 2
**Why it's relevant:** Continuing the Mofongo Monday series keeps the recurring content flywheel spinning. This week, spotlight the seafood mofongo (con camarones) to align with Lent — many of their Dominican and PR customers observe Lenten Fridays and appreciate seafood options all week. Keeps the Lenten tie-in going without being heavy-handed.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Mofongo Monday hits different during Lent 🦐🔥" Close-up hero shot of mofongo con camarones al ajillo. Play up the garlic butter sauce and plump shrimp. CTA: "Order now — this one sells out. 856-324-0269."

---

### Occasion 2: Lenten Friday Seafood Special (Mar 6, Friday)
**Date:** Friday, March 6
**Why it's relevant:** Third Friday of Lent. Many in La Cocina's community abstain from meat on Fridays during Lent (Cuaresma). This is a recurring weekly sales driver through April 2. Their camarones are a highlighted menu item — this gives a natural weekly push for the next month.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Viernes de Cuaresma — we got you 🦐" Showcase their seafood options: camarones, seafood mofongo, fish plates. No guilt-trip messaging — just "we've got what you need for Friday." CTA: "Pickup or delivery. Link in bio." Run this as a recurring Lenten Friday series.

---

### Occasion 3: International Women's Day (Mar 8, Sunday)
**Date:** Sunday, March 8
**Why it's relevant:** Community-driven occasion that resonates with La Cocina's family-first brand. The women behind La Cocina (cooks, staff, community matriarchs) are the backbone. This post humanizes the brand and drives engagement without needing a sales angle. Dominican and PR culture deeply honors mothers and women in the family — this lands emotionally.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Behind every plate at La Cocina is a woman with sazón 💪🌹" Feature the women on staff or in the kitchen (with permission). Keep it authentic — iPhone photo or quick reel, not overly produced. Bilingual caption: "Feliz Día de la Mujer" / "Happy International Women's Day." Engagement CTA: "Tag a woman who feeds your soul ❤️"

---

## Week 3: Mar 9 – 15

### Occasion 1: Mofongo Monday — Family Combo (Mar 9)
**Date:** Monday, March 9
**Why it's relevant:** Third installment of the Mofongo Monday series. By now, the audience expects it. This week, introduce a family combo angle — "Mofongo for the whole family." Drives larger order sizes and positions La Cocina for catering/family meal upsells.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Mofongo Monday is a family affair 🍽️" Show a family-size mofongo platter or combo (mofongo + rice + beans + drinks). Price-forward if possible. CTA: "Feed the family tonight. Call for family combos: 856-324-0269."

---

### Occasion 2: Pernil Spotlight (Mar 12, Wednesday)
**Date:** Wednesday, March 12
**Why it's relevant:** Pernil (slow-roasted pork) is La Cocina's second most promoted product after mofongo. It appeared in the pinned food blogger reel ("crispy pernil with skin cracking"). Mid-week content that highlights a different hero product prevents mofongo fatigue and showcases menu depth. The crispy skin is inherently visual and scroll-stopping.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "That crispy skin crackle 🔥🐷" Extreme close-up of pernil with crackling skin. Short caption — let the visual do the work. Caption: "Pernil so crispy you can hear it through the screen. Available daily. Order now." This is a saves-and-shares play — food ASMR energy.

---

### Occasion 3: Pi Day / Catering Push (Mar 14, Saturday)
**Date:** Saturday, March 14
**Why it's relevant:** Pi Day (3.14) is a fun hook that can be twisted into a food promotion. More importantly, spring event season is starting — quinceañeras, communion parties, corporate events. La Cocina has a full catering operation (EZCater). This post serves double duty: fun Pi Day content + spring catering reminder.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "3.14 reasons to cater with La Cocina this spring 🥧📐" (list 3 reasons: 1. Authentic sazón 2. Feeds a crowd 3. Everyone goes back for seconds + .14 = "and the price is right"). Showcase catering tray spread. CTA: "Book your spring event now — catering menu at ezcater.com or call 856-324-0269."

---

## Week 4: Mar 16 – 21

### Occasion 1: St. Patrick's Day (Mar 17, Tuesday)
**Date:** Tuesday, March 17
**Why it's relevant:** Mx specifically requested a St. Patrick's Day post. This requires a creative tie-in since La Cocina is a Latin restaurant, not Irish. The play: lean into the COLOR green — green plantains (tostones), green sofrito, green peppers, pigeon peas. "We do green our way." This turns a seemingly off-brand holiday into a fun, shareable post that celebrates La Cocina's identity THROUGH the lens of the holiday.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "St. Patrick's Day? Nah, it's San Patricio at La Cocina 🍀🇩🇴" Feature their greenest dishes: tostones (green plantain), mofongo (made from green plantains), anything with sofrito or green peppers. "We've been cooking green since day one." Fun, cheeky tone. Shareable — their audience will tag friends. CTA: "Come celebrate San Patricio with us — open all day. 856-324-0269."

---

### Occasion 2: Pica Pollo Thursday (Mar 19, Thursday)
**Date:** Thursday, March 19
**Why it's relevant:** Pica pollo (Dominican fried chicken) is one of La Cocina's signature items — called out in the pinned food blogger reel and multiple posts. A dedicated "Pica Pollo Thursday" post introduces another potential recurring theme (like Mofongo Monday) and showcases a different hero product. Thursday is a strong day for takeout orders (pre-weekend energy).
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Pica Pollo Thursday — golden, crispy, GONE 🍗🔥" Overhead shot of pica pollo basket or platter. Short, punchy caption. "The only question is: mild or spicy? Order now before we sell out." Urgency + decision CTA drives comments and orders.

---

### Occasion 3: First Day of Spring (Mar 20, Friday)
**Date:** Friday, March 20
**Why it's relevant:** Seasonal transition moment. After a cold winter, "first day of spring" posts perform well because they signal fresh starts and new energy. For La Cocina, this aligns with lighter lunch options, fresh juices, and outdoor catering season beginning. Also still Lent — seafood angle continues.
**Suggested campaign angle:** "Spring is here and the sazón is blooming 🌺🔥" Fresh, vibrant imagery — colorful plates, bright garnishes. Dual angle: celebrate spring + Lenten Friday seafood. CTA: "Kick off spring with a fresh plate. Open 8am-9pm. Order now." Could also tease upcoming spring catering availability.
