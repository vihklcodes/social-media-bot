# La Cocina — Brand Replication Blueprint

## 1. Brand Snapshot

La Cocina Tropical is a Dominican and Puerto Rican restaurant in the heart of Pennsauken, NJ's Hispanic community, serving bold, homestyle Latin Caribbean cuisine for 5+ years. Known for generous portions of mofongo, pernil, pica pollo, rotisserie chicken, and a rotating steam table. The brand identity is warm, loud, family-driven, and proudly bilingual (English/Spanish). Their Instagram is personality-driven — mixing promotional food posts with behind-the-scenes humor featuring staff member "Nia" and the owner. The vibe is "your neighborhood spot that feels like home" with a no-frills, come-as-you-are energy. They also run a catering operation and recently partnered with Afterpay.

- Promotional graphics alternate between **dark/black backgrounds** and **light/white backgrounds**
- The brand's official colors from the website are **green (#067A00)** and **orange (#FE741B)** — these appear in the logo and text overlays but NOT typically as background fills on Instagram posts
- Food tones are consistently warm browns and golden tans across all posts

## 3. Visual System Blueprint

**A. Overall Aesthetic Category:**
- **Primary:** Bold & colorful (high-contrast promotional graphics with heavy text)
- **Secondary:** UGC-heavy (casual behind-the-scenes reels, iPhone-shot content)

**B. Color Palette (observed from actual posts):**
- Dominant: Dark backgrounds (black/charcoal #23212B) for promotional static posts, warm food browns (#A87154, #6B4E3A)
- Accent: Brand green (#067A00), brand orange (#FE741B), white text overlays
- Background style: Solid dark backgrounds for promo graphics; natural restaurant interior for BTS content
- Feed color consistency: VARIED — no consistent color grid. Mix of dark promotional posts, light graphic posts, and natural-lit casual reels

**C. Image Composition Patterns (static photos — last 3 months):**
- **Very few static photos** — feed is ~75% Reels. Of the 12 most recent posts, only 3 are static photos (Posts 0, 1, 4)
- Camera angle: **45-degree dominant (~60%)** for food shots, with some overhead flat-lay for platters/spreads (~30%), and eye-level for interior/exterior (~10%)
- Close-up/wide ratio: ~50/50 — close-ups of individual dishes AND wide shots of full spreads/platters
- Centered composition is dominant — food placed center-frame
- **Edge-cropping:** Minimal — most food is fully contained in frame. Platters and spreads occasionally extend to edges (~20% of food posts)
- Negative space: LOW — images are filled with food, text overlays, or both
- People included: Yes — frequently in Reels (owner, staff member Nia). Rarely in static photos
- **Surface/table details:** Food photographed on white styrofoam takeout containers, aluminum trays, or directly on steam table. No styled surfaces
- **Plate/serving ware:** White styrofoam containers (most common), aluminum catering trays, occasional white ceramic plates. Takeout-style presentation
- Carousel: Not observed in recent posts

## 4. Website Typography System (PRIMARY font reference for Agent 3)

| Element | Font Family | Weight | Case | Color | Rendered Appearance |
|---------|------------|--------|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Headlines (H2)** | **Bebas Neue** | 400 (Regular) | Uppercase (natural — Bebas Neue defaults to caps appearance) | Green #067A00 (section heads) / White #FFFFFF (hero) | Tall, narrow, condensed sans-serif. Uniform stroke width. Very geometric and blocky when rendered at display size. Not decorative — clean, industrial, and punchy. Think tall skinny capital letters with no curves. |
| **Body text** | **DM Sans** | 500 (Medium) | Sentence case | Dark brown #594D36 / White #FFFFFF | Clean, modern, geometric sans-serif. Round letterforms, even weight. Highly readable. Friendly but professional. |
| **Sub-headings (H4)** | **Inter** | 700 (Bold) | Sentence case | Dark brown #594D36 | Neutral, humanist sans-serif. Slightly wider than DM Sans. Standard web body font feel. |
| **CTA Buttons** | System sans-serif | 700 (Bold) | Sentence case | White #FFFFFF on Orange #FD731B | Fully rounded pill shape (border-radius: 1000px). Bold, attention-grabbing. |

**Overall typographic personality:** Sans-serif-forward, modern-industrial. Bebas Neue headlines give a bold, urban, attention-grabbing feel — like a poster or street sign. DM Sans body text is clean and approachable. The combination reads as "bold neighborhood restaurant" not "fine dining."

---

## 5. Text Overlay Specifications

**Text frequency on images:** Always (on static photo posts) / Sometimes (reels have text in captions, not always overlaid on video)

**Text density:** Heavy headline style — 3-6 text elements per promotional post (headline, sub-headline, phone number, website, CTA, logo)

**Font style observed on Instagram posts:**
- Headlines: Bold block sans-serif (consistent with Bebas Neue from website)
- Sub-text: Clean sans-serif (consistent with DM Sans)
- Phone number: Always included (856-324-0269) in promotional posts

**Font case:** ALL CAPS for headlines ("MOFONGO", "DELICIOUS DINNER SPECIALS", "LA COCINA"). Mixed case for sub-headlines and body text.

**Font weight:** Bold / Extra Bold for headlines. Medium for body/sub-headlines.

**Font size relative to image:** Headlines span ~60-70% of image width. Very large and dominant. Sub-headlines ~30-40% of width.

**Text alignment:** Centered dominant (~70% of text-overlay posts). Left-aligned for body text in some posts (~30%).

**Text color:**
- White text on dark backgrounds (most common)
- Yellow/gold text for accent words ("MOFONGO" in yellow on Mofongo post)
- Green (#067A00) for brand text
- Orange (#FE741B) for CTA/accent text

**Text Placement MAP:**
- **Top of image:** ~40% of text-overlay posts (headline + logo at top)
- **Center of image:** ~30% (text integrated with food imagery)
- **Bottom of image:** ~30% (CTA, phone number, website at bottom)
- **Multi-zone:** Most promotional posts have text at BOTH top AND bottom (headline top, CTA/phone bottom), with food hero in center
- Posts 0, 4: Headline at top-left, phone/CTA at bottom
- The brand does NOT default to bottom-only text placement

**Text Background Treatment MAP:**
- **No background treatment (raw text on image):** ~50% — bold white/yellow text directly over dark food photos or dark backgrounds. Text weight carries readability.
- **Solid dark background:** ~30% — some posts use a fully dark/black background as the canvas, making text treatment unnecessary
- **Semi-transparent overlay:** ~10% — occasional gradient or tinted overlay
- **Brand color block:** ~10% — orange or green accent boxes behind specific CTAs

**Text decoration:**
- La Cocina circular logo placed in corner of most promotional posts
- Phone number icon (📞) used frequently
- Occasional emoji in overlays (🔥, 📍)
- No frames, borders, or sticker elements

## 6. Photography & Editing Profile

- **Lighting:** Warm overhead fluorescent (typical of fast-casual restaurant interior). Bright and slightly washed out. Not styled or studio-quality. Some posts show natural daylight from windows.
- **Editing style:** Minimal post-processing. Slight warm tone boost on some posts. No filters, no vintage effects, no heavy color grading. What-you-see-is-what-you-get.
- **Background/surface specifics:**
  - **Surface:** White styrofoam takeout containers and aluminum catering trays — no styled table surfaces. Hex from food zones: warm brown #D0A06C to #AC8C71
  - **Background walls:** Warm beige/cream interior walls #C7B79C to #E5D3BF (visible in BTS reels). Some exterior shots show the storefront/parking lot.
  - **Visible props/context:** Other food containers, drinks (juice cups visible in Post 3 area), steam table trays, napkins, condiment bottles. Cluttered, authentic, not styled.
- **Camera feel:** 100% iPhone casual. No DSLR. Slightly shaky in reels. Authentic, unpolished.
- **Dominant camera angle:** 45-degree for individual dishes (~60%), overhead for spreads/platters (~30%), eye-level for interior/people (~10%)

---

## 7. Graphic Design System

- **Use of templates:** Yes — promotional static posts follow a consistent template: dark background, La Cocina circular logo in corner, bold headline text, phone number, and food photography
- **Repeated design frames:** Circular logo badge consistently placed (usually top-left or top-right corner)
- **Borders:** None
- **Watermarks:** None beyond the logo
- **Logo placement:** Always visible on promotional static posts. Circular "La Cocina Latin Cuisine" badge in orange/gold on black. Placed in corner. NOT present on casual reels.
- **Consistent layout grid:** Loose — promotional posts follow a similar structure (logo corner, headline, food hero, CTA bottom) but not pixel-precise

---

## 8. Caption Architecture Guide

**Caption length:** SHORT — typically 1-4 lines for static posts. Slightly longer (4-8 lines) for reels with storytelling. Not paragraph-heavy.

**Hook style:** Mix of:
- Question hooks: "Dinner time ready?", "Looking for catering that impresses before the meeting even starts?"
- Bold statement hooks: "South Jersey Dominican food done RIGHT 🇩🇴🔥"
- Command/CTA hooks: "Come try our MOFONGO", "Huddle up! 🏈"
- Personal/casual hooks: "Another Nia work day well sort of 😂"

**Body structure:** Direct and promotional. Lists menu items, includes practical info (phone number, address). Occasionally tells a micro-story (food blogger style for the reel from external creator). No long-form storytelling from the brand itself.

**Emoji usage:** Moderate — 2-5 per post. Used inline (not as bullet points). Common emojis: 🔥 🏈 🌹 ❤️ 📍 😭 💀 🇩🇴 🚧. Emojis placed after phrases, not at line beginnings.

**Line break structure:** Short lines, single-spaced. Not double-spaced. No bullet-point formatting.

**CTA style:** Practical and direct:
- Phone number: "856-324-0269"
- Location: "📍La Cocina — 5010 Westfield Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08110"
- Action: "Come visit us at La Cocina", "Book La Cocina Catering for your next event"
- Engagement: "Share / repost / like", "Share / repost / comment"

**Hashtag placement:** End of caption (after line break in longer posts). Not in first comment.

**Hashtag count:** 3-8 per post (lighter than many brands)

**Bilingual elements:** YES — frequently. Spanish food names used naturally (mofongo, pernil, pica pollo, camarones, picadera, sazón). Highlight names in Spanish (Menú, Dirección, Horario, Contactos, Comidas, Ofertas). Some captions are primarily Spanish. Bilingual mixing feels natural, not forced.

**Voice/personality:** The brand sounds like a **proud neighborhood restaurant owner** — warm, direct, community-focused, occasionally funny. Not a food authority or influencer. More like "your tío who runs the best spot in town."

**Recurring phrases/patterns:**
- "La Cocina" (always referenced by name)
- Phone number included in many posts
- "Authentic Latin Cuisine" (appears on graphics)
- "sazón" (used casually in captions)
- "Come try" / "Come visit us" (direct invitations)

## 9. Real Caption Examples (Verbatim from Instagram)

### Caption 1 — Mofongo Promo (Static Photo, Pinned)
> Photo by La Cocina on January 07, 2026. May be an image of platter, plantains and text that says 'La Cocina AUTHENTIC LATIN CUISINE Come try our MOFONGO TRY THEM ALL! 856-324-0269'

**Analysis:** Ultra-short. Text is ON the image, not in the caption body. Direct CTA ("Come try our MOFONGO"), includes phone number. ALL CAPS product name. Brand stamp ("AUTHENTIC LATIN CUISINE"). This is their default promotional post format.

---

**Analysis:** Longest caption style. Storytelling with vivid food descriptions ("crispy pernil with skin cracking"). Bilingual food names. Ends with location pin and hashtags. This was likely from a food blogger collaboration (Pinned = they're proud of this one). Emojis at start (🇩🇴🔥) and mid-caption (📍). Warm, proud tone. "Feels like home" = core brand emotion.

---

### Caption 5 — Super Bowl / Game Day (Reel)
> "Huddle up! 🏈 Picadera perfect for the Benito Bowl or Super Bowl party — still taking orders!"

**Analysis:** Short, punchy. Sports hook ("Huddle up!"). Bilingual food reference ("Picadera"). Timely urgency ("still taking orders!"). Casual tone.

## 10. Tone & Voice Encoding

**Brand Tone in 3 Words:** Proud, Warm, Direct

**Personality archetype:** The Neighborhood Tío — a proud, warm, community-rooted restaurant owner who speaks in a mix of English and Spanish, loves feeding people, and doesn't need fancy marketing to get you in the door. Occasionally funny (Nia content), always genuine.

**Words/phrases frequently used:**
- "Authentic Latin Cuisine" (brand tagline on graphics)
- "sazón" (cultural pride word)
- "Come try" / "Come visit us"
- Spanish food names: mofongo, pernil, pica pollo, camarones, picadera
- "856-324-0269" (phone number in nearly every promotional post)
- "Share / repost" (engagement ask)

**Words/phrases never used:**
- "Hidden gem" / "Foodie paradise" / "Game changer"
- Corporate language ("leverage," "curated," "elevated")
- Overly trendy food language ("insane," "fire" as standalone adjective, "bussin")
- Fine dining vocabulary ("artisanal," "craft," "farm-to-table")

**Energy level:** 7/10 — enthusiastic and warm but not manic. Confident without being loud. The Reels with Nia push to 8-9/10 (humor, personality). Promotional posts are a steady 6-7.
