# Cloud Social Media - AI Campaign Experiment: Merchant Selection

## Experiment Overview

**Objective:** Select top 10 restaurant merchants to run an AI-generated social media campaign experiment. Each merchant will receive 3 AI-generated campaigns based on relevant occasions tied to their business (e.g., Taco Tuesday, Happy Hour, Valentine's Day, Super Bowl Sunday, etc.).

**Success Metrics:** Engagement uplift, follower growth, and correlation to DoorDash order volume (MP/SF weekly averages).

---

## Selection Criteria

Merchants were evaluated on the following:

- **Follower tier diversity** -- spread across <100, 100-5K, and 5K+ to measure how AI campaigns perform at different audience sizes
- **MP Weekly Avg** -- higher is better (more revenue to protect and grow)
- Active Instagram account with existing photo/video content
- Low current engagement (room for measurable uplift)
- Cuisine type that aligns with occasion-based marketing
- Positive merchant relationship (no "No Show" flags, not private accounts)

## Top 10 Merchant Picks (Diversified by Follower Tier)

### TIER 1: <100 Followers (Starting from Scratch)
> These merchants test whether AI campaigns can build an audience from nearly zero.

---

### 1. Sumo Ramen Market City
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | <100 Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@sumoramenmarketcity](https://www.instagram.com/sumoramenmarketcity/) |
| **Followers** | 88 |
| **Content** | Photos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 417.5 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 60.0 |

**Why:** The best blank canvas in the dataset. Only 2 posts and 88 followers, yet the **highest MP weekly average (417.5)** -- this is a thriving delivery business with virtually no social presence. Any engagement represents near-infinite percentage growth, making this the strongest "before/after" proof-of-concept. Ramen = **cold weather comfort campaigns, late-night cravings, Lunar New Year, rainy day specials.**

---

### 2. Thai Cortez
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | <100 Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@thai.cortez](https://www.instagram.com/thai.cortez/) |
| **Followers** | 64 |
| **Content** | Photos and videos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 41.2 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 40.7 |

**Why:** "Friendly merchant, definitely needs help to increase instagram usage, only posts videos of food here and there." The merchant relationship is strong and they are eager for help. What makes Thai Cortez interesting is the SF/MP ratio -- SF weekly (40.7) nearly matches MP weekly (41.2), meaning they have an unusually strong storefront presence relative to marketplace. AI campaigns here test whether social media can shift the balance and drive more marketplace orders from an engaged local customer base. Thai cuisine = **Thai New Year (Songkran), Pad Thai Tuesday, spicy food challenges, happy hour curry specials.**

---

### TIER 2: 100 - 5,000 Followers (Building Momentum)
> These merchants have a foundation but haven't broken through. AI campaigns test mid-stage growth acceleration.

---

### 3. Falafel Corner
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | 100-5K Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@falafelcornerdowntown](https://www.instagram.com/falafelcornerdowntown/) |
| **Followers** | 445 |
| **Content** | Photos and videos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 1,806.0 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 129.1 |

**Why:** The **highest MP weekly in the entire dataset by a massive margin (1,806.0).** This is a delivery powerhouse with only 445 followers -- the gap between business performance and social presence is enormous. Any social engagement uplift here protects and grows the most revenue of any merchant in the experiment. Mediterranean/falafel cuisine = **Meatless Monday, Mediterranean diet trends, lunch specials, late-night healthy eats.**

---

### 4. Los Ocampos
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | 100-5K Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@losocamporestaurants](https://www.instagram.com/losocamporestaurants/) |
| **Followers** | 2,840 |
| **Content** | Photos and videos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 960.8 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 190.9 |

**Why:** Second-highest MP weekly (960.8) and **highest SF weekly (190.9)** in the dataset. This merchant has the most loyal customer base by far -- nearly 191 storefront orders per week. Already uses "influencer videos, photos" showing marketing sophistication. Mexican restaurant = **Taco Tuesday, Cinco de Mayo, Margarita Monday, family meal deals, holiday catering.** Multi-location business amplifies campaign impact.

---

### 5. Tee Jayes Country Place
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | 100-5K Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@teejayescountryplace](https://www.instagram.com/teejayescountryplace/) |
| **Followers** | 1,035 |
| **Content** | Photos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 951.2 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 70.9 |

**Why:** Third-highest MP weekly (951.2) with strong SF (70.9). Posts "updates, promos, some menu items" -- they're trying but need better content. Country/comfort food is underrepresented in social media marketing but has massive occasion potential: **Sunday brunch, comfort food Fridays, holiday family meals, breakfast specials, rainy day classics.** The 1,035 follower base is a solid mid-tier foundation to build from.

---

### 6. Halal Express
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | 100-5K Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@halalexpressnj](https://www.instagram.com/halalexpressnj/) |
| **Followers** | 1,281 |
| **Content** | Videos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 337.0 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 13.3 |

**Why:** "They post really good food focused videos but still doesn't get any engagement." This is the clearest case of a strategy gap -- the content quality is there, the audience response isn't. AI-generated campaigns can fix the messaging and occasion hooks that turn good content into engagement. Halal cuisine = **Ramadan/Iftar specials, weekend family platters, lunch deals.** MP weekly of 337.0 is strong.

---

### 7. Burger Bun
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | 100-5K Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@burgerbunla](https://www.instagram.com/burgerbunla/) |
| **Followers** | 2,422 |
| **Content** | Photos and some videos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 283.9 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 4.1 |

**Why:** Noted for "high quality videos" with low engagement -- AI campaigns can amplify existing content excellence. Burgers are the most versatile occasion food in the experiment: **Super Bowl Sunday, National Burger Day, Father's Day, July 4th, game day watch parties, Friday night cravings.** MP weekly of 283.9 is solid and the LA market provides high-density audience reach.

---

### TIER 3: 5,000+ Followers (Established but Underperforming)
> These merchants have audience scale but can't convert it to engagement. AI campaigns test whether better content unlocks dormant reach.

---

### 8. Kaisen Don
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | 5K+ Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@kaisendon1939](https://www.instagram.com/kaisendon1939/) |
| **Followers** | 15,700 |
| **Content** | Photos and videos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 272.0 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 153.7 |

**Why:** 15,700 followers with low engagement = the largest dormant audience in the experiment. Already does influencer marketing, so they understand promotional strategies. SF weekly of 153.7 is exceptional -- a loyal customer base primed to engage with occasion content. Japanese poke bowls = **Lunar New Year, Valentine's Day date night, New Year health kicks, summer fresh eating.** Strong MP (272.0) adds revenue weight.

---

### 9. La Cocina
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tier** | 5K+ Followers |
| **Instagram** | [@lacocina_nj](https://www.instagram.com/lacocina_nj/) |
| **Followers** | 8,598 |
| **Content** | Photos and videos |
| **Engagement** | Low |
| **MP Weekly Avg** | 231.0 |
| **SF Weekly Avg** | 9.1 |

**Why:** The "tries everything but nothing works" merchant. Does "boosted content, sponsored listings, posts every day" but "haven't cracked the code." This is the ideal test case for whether AI-generated occasion campaigns outperform a merchant's own efforts. Mexican cuisine = **Taco Tuesday, Cinco de Mayo, Margarita Monday, Valentine's Day dinner.** Their posting discipline means AI content will actually get deployed consistently.

### 10. GRILLRILLA (3 locations)
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|

Grill cuisine = **Father's Day, Memorial Day, July 4th, tailgate season, Super Bowl.** Multi-location format means each campaign drives traffic across 3 stores, tripling the measurable impact.

| **Jim's Famous Burgers** | 3,978 | 199.4 | Strong candidate, would be #11 -- displaced by Tee Jayes' higher MP |
