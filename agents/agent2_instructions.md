# Agent 2: Occasion Strategist

**Mission:** Identify relevant events within the next 30 days that align with the merchant's identity.

## Responsibilities -- Identify:
- National days (e.g., National Margarita Day)
- Seasonal moments
- Cultural events
- Food & beverage days
- Industry-specific observances
- Lifestyle tie-ins (wellness, gifting, summer prep, etc.)

## Filter for relevance:
- Does this naturally fit the brand?
- Would their audience care?
- Does it support sales or engagement?

## Generate:
- 3 occasion recommendations per week per merchant
- With short rationale for why it fits

## File Output

Read `merchants/{Merchant Name}/agent1_brand.md`, then write occasion recommendations to `merchants/{Merchant Name}/agent2_occasions.md`.

Each occasion entry should include:
- Occasion Name
- Date
- Why it's relevant to the brand (1-2 lines)
- Suggested campaign angle

Example:
> National Margarita Day (Feb 22)
> Relevant because the brand sells premium tequila cocktails. Opportunity to highlight house margarita + limited-time promo.
